My full name is Sunpech Steven Suwatanapongched. I mostly just go by Steven. I also go by Spong, which comes from a combination of letters from <b>S</b> from <b>S</b>teven, and <b>Pong</b> from Suwatana<b>pong</b>ched.

I grew up in Chicago, Illinois. I'm half Thai and half Chinese. I've lived in several cities from Boston, Bangkok, to Los Angeles. I'm currently live in Chicago, IL. <br />

I enjoy software development, photography, food, reading, blogging, traveling, and other stuff. <br />

I have a BA in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.bu.edu/">Boston University</a> and an MS in Information Systems from <a href="http://www.depaul.edu/">Depaul University</a>.

<h2>Software Development and Blogging</h2>
I enjoy solving problems, and coding is one of the ways I go about creating solutions. I've done consulting for several years using Microsoft .Net technologies. My current interests are in Ruby on Rails and mobile development. I do enjoy networking and going to local user groups and meetups regarding various technologies.

I have a <a href="http://github.com/sunpech">Github</a> and <a href="http://bitbucket.org/sunpech">Bitbucket</a> accounts where I host some of my projects-- most of which are private.<br />

I like to contribute my idle CPU cycles to help crunch some numbers for a good cause. See <a href="/wcg/">Team Spong World Community Grid</a>.<br />

I'm also a casual blogger. I've been blogging since 1999. I've written my own blog software using various tools back then. From Perl, PHP, MySQL, ASP, ASP.net, C#, and MSSQL. I've also used several blogging platforms from Wordpress, Posterous, Blogger, and finally to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> using <a href="jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. My old blog is at: <a href="http://spong.org/">spong.org</a>.

<h2>Photography</h2>
I'm also a photographer. I generally take my camera most places and take pictures of whatever I find interesting.

I have a photography site at <a href="http://sunpechphotography.com/">sunpechphotography.com</a>.

I'm also on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SunpechPhotography">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://500px.com/">500px</a>, <a href="http://www.instagram.com/sunpechphoto">Instagram</a>, <a href="http://www.twenty20.com/sunpech">Twenty20</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sunpech/">Flickr</a>.

I enjoy all kinds of photography, but have stronger interests in landscape, HDR, and event/journalistic photographs. I'm beginning to do some headshot/portrait photography. In case you're curious here is a </span><a href="http://www.sunpech.com/p/my-camera-gear.html">list of my camera gear</a>.

<h2>Food and Travel</h2>
I'm a bit of a foodie. I often eat out at great places and will take pictures of the food to share with everyone. I use my Android phone to take a lot food pictures. I've switched over to use my DSLR more these days.

I have a food site at <a href="http://www.foodishappiness.com/">Foodishappiness.com</a> (under <a href="http://alpha.foodishappiness.com/">development</a>). I also tweet at <a href="http://twitter.com/foodishappiness">@foodishappiness</a> <i>sometimes</i>.<br />

I'm a traveler of awesome places. Every year I try to travel to a city I've never been before. Since 2007, I've been to: Seattle, Portland, Vancouver, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver, New York City, Boston, Baltimore, Las Vegas, Singapore, Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Hua Hin, Phang Nga, Phuket, and Pattaya. As part of my travels, I take pictures, eat delicious food, and share it.
