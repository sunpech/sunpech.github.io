My full name is Sunpech Steven Suwatanapongched. I mostly just go by Steven. I also go by Spong, which comes from a combination of letters from **S** from **S**teven, and **Pong** from Suwatana**pong**ched.

I grew up in Chicago, Illinois. I'm half Thai and half Chinese. I've lived in several cities from Boston, Bangkok, to Los Angeles. I currently live in Chicago, IL.

I enjoy software development, photography, food, reading, blogging, traveling, and other stuff.

I have a BA in Computer Science from [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/) and an MS in Information Systems from [Depaul University](http://www.depaul.edu/).

## Software Development and Blogging

I enjoy solving problems, and coding is one of the ways I go about creating solutions. I've done consulting for several years using Microsoft .Net technologies. My current interests are in Ruby on Rails and mobile development. I do enjoy networking and going to local user groups and meetups regarding various technologies.

I have [Github](http://github.com/sunpech) and [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/sunpech) accounts where I host some of my projects-- most of which are private.

I like to contribute my idle CPU cycles to help crunch some numbers for a good cause. See [Team Spong World Community Grid](http://wcg.spong.org/)

I'm also a casual blogger. I've been blogging since 1999. I've written my own blog software using various tools back then. From Perl, PHP, MySQL, ASP, ASP.net, C#, and MSSQL. I've also used several blogging platforms from Wordpress, Posterous, Blogger, and finally to [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). My old blog is at: [spong.org](http://spong.org/).

## Photography
I'm also a photographer. I generally take my camera most places and take pictures of whatever I find interesting.

I have a photography site at [sunpechphotograpy.com](http://sunpechphotography.com/).

I'm also on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SunpechPhotography), [500px](http://500px.com/sunpech), [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/sunpech), [Twenty20](http://www.twenty20.com/sunpech), and [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sunpech/).

I enjoy all kinds of photography, but have stronger interests in landscape, HDR, and event/journalistic photographs. I'm beginning to do some headshot/portrait photography. In case you're curious here is a [list of my camera gear](/best/camera-gear).

## Food and Travel
I'm a bit of a foodie. I often eat out at great places and will take pictures of the food to share with everyone. I use my Android phone to take a lot food pictures. I've switched over to use my DSLR more these days.

I have a food site at [Foodishappiness](http://www.foodishappiness.com) (under [development](http://alpha.foodishappiness.com/)). I also tweet at [@foodishappiness](http://twitter.com/foodishappiness) *sometimes*.

I'm a traveler of awesome places. Every year I try to travel to a city I've never been before. Since 2007, I've been to: Seattle, Portland, Vancouver, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver, New York City, Boston, Baltimore, Las Vegas, Singapore, Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Hua Hin, Phang Nga, Phuket, and Pattaya. As part of my travels, I take pictures, eat delicious food, and share it.
