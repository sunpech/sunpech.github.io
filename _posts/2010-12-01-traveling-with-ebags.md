As many of you may or may not know, I've been traveling a lot lately.  From July's trip to the San Diego Comic-Con, to September's All-You-Can-Jet pass, to even now, Thailand!  It's been awesome, but there's a special shout-out I need to give recognition to: <a href="http://www.ebags.com/">eBags.com</a>

On October 5, 2010, at the end of my All-You-Can-Jet vacationing, after hitting up 5 cities in one month, my main traveling bag: the Mother Lode eTech Junior 25 Wheeled Duffel, had ripped at the baggage claim at O'hare International Airport.  I arrived home after one month of traveling, to have one of my bag handles ripped off!

I really like the bags from eBags.  They are wonderfully designed and super durable.  I don't know how this bag was handled from Long Beach to Chicago, where a bag handle could be ripped off as such.

See images below of what happened:

I tweeted it out, and the eBags twitter account actual caught sight of my tweet, and tweeted back that I should contact their support center to take care of the issue.  Which I did.  I emailed them with links to the pictures I took above, and they promptly replied back for me to call their warranty center.  Which I did.  I called them up and they pulled up my account.  I was surprised to learn that they had documented my previous email with pictures, so our phone conversation was short.

They said next time to contact O'hare for the damages, but since all bags made by eBags have a lifetime warranty, they were going to send me a replacement and to throw out the damaged bag!  Awesome.  I didn't even know my bag had a lifetime warranty.  The replacement bag (same color, blue) came in the mail a few days later.

A week or so after that, I ended up ordering the larger 29" (orange) for my trip to Thailand.  And here from Bangkok, Thailand, I want to say thank-you to eBags for their great customer support.  As you can see in the picture below, I have a nice set of eBags for my Thailand adventures
