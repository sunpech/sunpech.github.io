Yesterday I was in Chicago with hopes of getting some nice photos of *Chicago henge*-- basically the fall equinox where the sunset lines up straight with the East-West street grid. But there were some clouds in the sky which prevented any starburst from happening. However, I went early enough to do some exploring around downtown for other fun shots.

In particular I hopped on the CTA and looked for some train shots on the 'L'. My favorite by far was at the [Adams/Wabash CTA station](http://www.transitchicago.com/travel_information/station.aspx?StopId=14). There are two walkways that cross on top of the elevated trains, both north and south. I chose the north walkway as it had a direct lineup with the tracks.

**Note:** I've dropped linking to [Nuvango](http://nuvango.com/) now, as I just got an email as I'm writing this that they will be cease being a marketplace for artists in mid-October. Instead they will transform into an eCommerce platform and all artists profile pages will cease to exist.

### Black and Whites

I took some photos around the CTA stations and surrounding areas too. You can check out my [Facebook Chicago album](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.951834838214874.1073741896.408588035872893&type=3) for more.
