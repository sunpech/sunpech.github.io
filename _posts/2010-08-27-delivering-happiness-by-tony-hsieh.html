A few months ago,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hsieh">Tony Hsieh</a>,&nbsp;the CEO of <a href="http://www.zappos.com/">Zappos</a>, offered free copies of his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Delivering-Happiness-Profits-Passion-Purpose/dp/0446563048?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;link_code=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969" target="_blank">Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=sunpech-20&amp;l=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969&amp;o=1&amp;a=0446563048" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;" width="1" />&nbsp;via&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/ZAPPOS">his twitter</a>. &nbsp;I hopped on it right away and got myself two copies of it by using two different email addresses. &nbsp;I gave one away to a friend and kept the remaining copy to myself to keep and read.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. &nbsp;It's inspirational how Tony Hsieh started his company out, taking the big risks he did, despite the economic conditions of the Dot Com bubble burst. &nbsp;It was pretty amazing how he built the culture around his company and the success that followed thereafter.<br /><br />The reading is pretty light and casual. &nbsp;If anything, it may be a little too casual as Tony Hsieh noted he wanted to keep it very basic and like a conversation. &nbsp;I think it could have used a little help from an editor, with a little bit more formal editing, but maybe at the risk of losing what makes Tony Hsieh a great CEO of the greatest online service store that happen to sell shoes.<br /><br />Coincidentally, I am at a point in my life where I'm making a lot of changes to my professional and personal life. &nbsp;This book has definitely helped me put things into perspective. &nbsp;It was great timing for me to pick up and finish reading the book when I did. &nbsp;<i>Delivering Happiness</i> is a fantastic book to read if you want to see how a great company was formed and sustained-- but also for personal growth to find happiness.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Delivering-Happiness-Profits-Passion-Purpose/dp/0446563048?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;link_code=bil&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img alt="Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose" src="http://ws.amazon.com/widgets/q?MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ASIN=0446563048&amp;tag=sunpech-20" /></a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=sunpech-20&amp;l=bil&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969&amp;o=1&amp;a=0446563048" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;" width="1" />
