Last weekend I installed <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a> onto my Lenovo Thinkpad T60 laptop.  I wanted to keep Windos XP Professional installed, so I chose to dual-boot it using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">GRUB</a>.  I also upgraded the 40 GB hard drive to a 250 GB hard drive using a laptop hard drive upgrade kit.  I copied the files over to the new drive, and then installed Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron) in another partition.  It was amazingly simple.<br /><br />My reason for installing Linux is because I miss it.  Almost ten years ago I got into Linux (Mandrake and Red Hat) in the first place because I was sick of Windows 98.  Win98, which I do not consider an operating system (OS) simply because it does not manage system processes whatsoever.  <br /><br />What made me sick was that I could not get my work done on it and I truly enjoyed my school's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_Operating_System">Solaris</a> machines (I was an undergrad at <a href="http://www.bu.edu/">Boston University</a>).  It's been a few years since I truly used Linux for many of my computing needs.  And here I am getting back into that.<br /><br />Tomorrow, 8.10 will be released and I will again be upgrading my OS.  The picture below is of my system running 8.04.  Notice my G1 next to it.<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SQknkFkDphI/AAAAAAAAIQw/9D8L3k8Sdwg/s1600-h/IMG_0076.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5262781140481320466" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SQknkFkDphI/AAAAAAAAIQw/9D8L3k8Sdwg/s400/IMG_0076.JPG" style="cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; height: 267px; width: 400px;" /></a><br /><br />On the screen I have <a href="http://conky.sourceforge.net/">Conky</a> running along with <a href="http://getsongbird.com/">Songbird</a>.  You probably can't see it from the angle this was taken.
