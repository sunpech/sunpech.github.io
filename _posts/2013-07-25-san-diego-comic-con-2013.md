Last week I was in San Diego for <a href="http://www.comic-con.org/cci">Comic-Con</a>. This was my third time at SDCC and I had a great time as usual. I took pictures as usual, but unlike previous years, I went to more panels than any other year.

Here are my albums on G+ (and Facebook-- FB):

### Some Thoughts

What I loved about this con was the amount of participation by young fans (kids) and girls cosplaying. A bigger demographic outside the typical teen to 40+ year old guys are now in attendance. A lot of families went together too. I also saw kids going up to the microphone to ask questions at comic panels! There's probably a greater percentage of kids that are more in tune with <i>actual comics</i> than adults at Comic Con now. This is great!

<img alt=""  border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uL8-3dnscRg/Ue-Q2H056xI/AAAAAAABhFE/C2jNth1Uvss/s600/2013-07-20+at+18-50-36.jpg"  />

Also, too often at <i>guy-oriented </i>conventions, there are scantily-clad booth babes at every aisle. This year, there weren't so many. It does bother me if the message being sent to young girls that cosplaying means to <i>only</i> dress in some sexy bikini costume. Again, the feel of Comic-con is a bit more family friendly.

<img alt=""  border="0"  src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ISJpiEFA9cg/Ue-Po2S5HwI/AAAAAAABg-k/UW6a7WmiXL0/s600/2013-07-19+at+12-16-04.jpg"  />

There's usually like 100,000+ people that go each year, and the exhibit floor is packed shoulder to shoulder. This year, the layout had a big improvement. They spaced out some of the bigger booths out so the traffic wouldn't be so heavy in certain areas. Granted, certain booths areas will always be crowded-- the WB, Fox, Legendary Pictures, etc. So it definitely felt more balanced, and not every movie studio had a booth this year-- which again, I think is good because the event is Comic-con, <i>not Movie/Entertainment-con</i>.

A few things I didn't like and can see room for improvement is how they handle the big panels (Hall H and Ballroom 20). There are just too many people that want to get into these rooms. They don't empty out the room after a panel-- which I agree with, but to actually get in requires sleeping in line overnight or even getting in line at 6 or 7 am! You just have to be hardcore about getting into these big rooms. This has been a trend for a while now, <i>maybe it's time to consider getting a bigger venue that can accommodate more people? Or maybe consider selling tickets to these panels?</i>

As much as I love taking pictures of cosplayers at Comic-con, I felt this year was somewhat of a disappointment. The costumes were just okay overall-- at least from what I saw in person. There were some good costumes there, judging from other pictures found on the Internet, but I think I may have missed a lot of them because I was in more panels this year and didn't walk the floor as much. <i>Or maybe</i> it's because I go to <a href="http://www.anime-expo.org/">Anime Expo</a>, which is the convention that has the best cosplayers in my absolute honest opinion. AX is just amazing when it comes to cosplay.

Just like previous years, Comic-con is becoming less and less about actual comics, and more about big media/industry with their large booths. As I heard, it costs like $200,000 for a certain comic publisher to get space on the floor! That <i>seems very expensive</i> considering very few people, percentage-wise, actually visit publisher booths. The big movie and entertainment booths get the most visitors from what I see.

I do plan on going next year again. I hope to one day get into Hall H and witness a big announcement in person. This event gets bigger every year, but I have to wonder if and when it will get too big where parts or communities will start their own specialized event. In a way, it already has since there are other comic conventions in the Southern California region taking place already-- Wondercon, Comikaze Expo, SoCal Comic Con, Long Beach Comic Con, etc. So in a way, unless it's comic-related, I'd rather it not be at Comic-Con.
