This is my last of three posts covering the three landmarks I visited in Chicago during this past winter. My first was of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sunpech.com/2014/01/photos-from-chicagos-john-hancock.html">Chicago's John Hancock Observatory</a>&nbsp;and the other was of <a href="http://www.sunpech.com/2014/01/photos-from-chicagos-bean.html">Chicago's Bean</a>.<br /><br />The last landmark I visited was of a sunset from Chicago's Adler Planetarium. I visited the Adler before and took pictures there-- but this was all when I first started to get into some HDR and photography. The blog post is still up <a href="http://www.sunpech.com/2012/03/weekend-chicago-hdr-photography.html">here</a>. Please don't judge me too harshly on those old photos.<br /><br />This sunset trip was fun to be on as the weather in Chicago was warming up and the snow was melting a bit. But there was still plenty of ice along the lake. I wasn't able to venture close to the lake as it was a very real possibility of slipping and falling right into Lake Michigan.<br /><br />You can view my full album from Chicago&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/101693597219413173200/albums/5966991023328463857">here</a>.<br /><br /><b>Chicago Winter Sunset</b><br />Buy print:&nbsp;<a href="http://500pxart.com/photo/58449824">http://500pxart.com/photo/58449824</a><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kWmgKh2VP3c/UteDJfhJZ0I/AAAAAAABl4c/KLz7N_h1A84/s1600/2014-01-12+at+16-56-36.jpg" imageanchor="1"><span style="color: black;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /></span><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kWmgKh2VP3c/UteDJfhJZ0I/AAAAAAABl4c/KLz7N_h1A84/s1600/2014-01-12+at+16-56-36.jpg" height="360" width="640" /></a><br /><br /><b>Chicago from the Adler Planetarium</b><br />Buy print:&nbsp;<a href="http://500pxart.com/photo/57661802">http://500pxart.com/photo/57661802</a><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fmjoN5zagrQ/UteDKVUZ2GI/AAAAAAABl4k/mszOUp4gOJc/s1600/2014-01-12+at+17-51-42.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fmjoN5zagrQ/UteDKVUZ2GI/AAAAAAABl4k/mszOUp4gOJc/s1600/2014-01-12+at+17-51-42.jpg" height="360" width="640" /></a><br /><br /><b>Chicago Skyline - Peace</b><br />Buy print:&nbsp;<a href="http://500pxart.com/photo/57866660">http://500pxart.com/photo/57866660</a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-K5Nalnzt9RY/UteDLDaN2gI/AAAAAAABl4s/zx_wfMLoXyU/s1600/2014-01-12+at+18-13-20.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-K5Nalnzt9RY/UteDLDaN2gI/AAAAAAABl4s/zx_wfMLoXyU/s1600/2014-01-12+at+18-13-20.jpg" height="360" width="640" /></a><br /><br />
