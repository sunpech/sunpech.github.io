When I design websites and always wonder what the site would look like on different screen resolutions. I don't always have all the devices to test the layout on, so I generally will prefer to resize my browser window. I once had a wallpaper that had different screen resolutions marked out, but I couldn't find it or google it. So I decided to make my own.

I joined <a href="http://www.pixelapse.com/">Pixelapse.com</a> and made a desktop wallpaper project. I found this site by <i>googling </i><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=git+psd+version+control&amp;oq=git+psd+version+control&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0j69i64.5534j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=git+photoshop+version+control"><i>'git photoshop version control'</i></a>. The project is in Photoshop.

My screen is a 2560x1440 resolution 27" Mac display, so I made the wallpaper for that size. So it's ideal if your screen resolution matches that. Just resize your web browser to align with the markings and it should give you a good idea what the site looks like on that screen resolution.

Hope you enjoy it, it's free for everybody!
