Last year I did some traveling in October and November. In late October, I went to Toronto for the first time. The city is beautiful there. I've probably been in Los Angeles too long, but I noticed how clear the skies were and was astonished to look at buildings with no haze in front. It really showcases how LA is such a polluted and dirty city.

While I was there I got a chance to see <i>Ai Weiwei's Forever Bicycle exhibit</i>. I can't believe there are 3,144 bicycles in the sculpture. It is quite mesmerizing though. I took some night photos there, that you can see the album <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/+StevenSuwatanapongched/albums/5940914158795778913">here</a>.

I also visited the very so colorful, <a href="http://www.kensington-market.ca/">Kensington Market</a>. Pictures can be found <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/+StevenSuwatanapongched/albums/5940913815147924913">here</a>.

And my general photos from Toronto can be found <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/+StevenSuwatanapongched/albums/5940913477363035793">here</a>.

The biggest thing I wanted to leave Toronto with was pictures of their skyline. Which I did. It was a bit cold out there and I did suffer a bit in the cold to get some long exposures done. Normally I would do some HDR shots, but I found long exposures to produce more interesting results with the colors running across the water.

Here are three of my favorites of the Toronto skyline.

I hope to return in the near future to take some more photos there. Toronto reminds me so much of Chicago-- clean, big, metropolitan, yet also suburban-like, with some of the most friendliest people around. My biggest praise for the city is that it has some delicious Chinese food there-- way better than Chicago's! I could almost live there if it weren't for all the <i>funny money</i> they use up there-- just kidding, I love Toronto.
