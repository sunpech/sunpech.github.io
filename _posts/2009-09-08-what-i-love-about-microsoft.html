<p>I am primarily a Microsoft software developer.&#160; But I was not always a M$FT user/developer so to speak.&#160; I used to use Windows 3.1 back in the heyday, followed a little with Windows 95/98.&#160; But by then, I was a college student at <a href="http://www.bu.edu" target="_blank">Boston University</a>.&#160; The computer labs there had primarily Unix terminals and Solaris boxes.&#160; So I naturally had to use and learn these technologies.&#160; Everything from using the command shell, pine, star office, gcc compiler, etc.&#160; It wasn’t easy to pick up, but a great learning experience nonetheless.&#160; I later used Linux (Red Hat/Mandrake) on my home PCs.</p>  <p>Now, to the point of my blog.</p>  <p>I love how Microsoft treats college students so well.&#160; Over my undergraduate years (1997-2001), more and more terminals were turning into Windows NT/2000 workstations, donated of course by Microsoft.&#160; There were group meetings that they setup on campus to promote their products and give away free software and development tools such Visual Studio 6.0 and Windows 2000 Professional beta.</p>  <p>Present day: Hundreds and thousands of dollars worth of software are still being distributed.&#160; Check out the following sites that offer students (high school through graduate level students at colleges/universities) free Microsoft software:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/academic/default.aspx" target="_blank">MSDN Academic Alliance</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://www.dreamspark.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft DreamSpark</a> </li> </ul>  <p>Now, from a business standpoint, this is smart.&#160; Microsoft gives these software freely to poor college students and gets them hooked.&#160; When these students graduate and move into the working world, they’ll naturally want to continue using all the Microsoft software.</p>  <p>From a developer’s point-of-view, Microsoft gives so much to academics.&#160; I was a PHP/MySQL developer before I started developing projects with ASP.net.&#160; Why did I switch over?—Because I got their IDE, Visual Studio .Net for free!&#160; All I had to do was attend a Microsoft launch event.&#160; If I had to personally pay for the software, I probably would never have gotten started using Microsoft technologies.&#160; I would have been happy freely using LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQl, PHP).</p>  <p>Now, this probably does sound as though Microsoft is a crack dealer or something.&#160; They get you hooked and you never get out!&#160; Funny, but somewhat true.</p>
