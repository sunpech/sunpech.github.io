I was recently featured in a <a href="http://500px.com/blog">500px blog</a> post, <a href="http://500px.com/blog/1029/celebrating-3-months-of-500px-art">Celebrating 3 Months of 500px Art!</a> The new site launched back in December and I've actually bought several of my prints just to see what the quality was like.

Below are some photos from two separate orders I made. The packaging is really well done, and they consolidated two prints into one big box.

Overall they're pretty good. 500px offers canvas, paper, aluminum, acrylic, and birchwood as print material. I'm not a fan of the canvas print, as the picture I chose didn't come out as sharp as I wanted, but <b>I absolutely love the aluminum print</b>. I consider the aluminum prints to be the best value as they look absolutely amazing-- the darks are dark, and the light is pretty shiny. I have an aluminum print of <a href="http://500px.com/photo/54143106">Golden Gate Bridge's Clear Night</a> hanging over my desk. It has a different look and feel during the day and night.

Hanging the prints on my wall was also very easy. Just follow the instructions and use the bubble level to make sure it's straight. On the back of each print is a thank-you note from 500px. It's removable of course, but to be honest I've left them on all of my hanging prints.

Again, here is my photo they selected. Apparently it's <i>one of the top 16 selling photos</i> on <a href="http://500pxart.com/">500px Art </a>right now!
