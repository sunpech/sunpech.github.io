I've been using OS X as my main OS for almost five years now. But one thing that's bugged me for a while was the lack of support for Logitech and other mice's forward and back buttons. These are mouse shortcut buttons found on many gaming mice. As much as I enjoy Apple's trackpad, I still like to use the mouse for gaming and other things.<br /><br />Here's a picture of my mouse with the buttons that under Windows, normally maps to forward and back in the web browser.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dpn72wPZcxs/VSWVi7M-1NI/AAAAAAAB5F8/5zsjQZdaOn4/s1600/IMG_20150408_153732.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dpn72wPZcxs/VSWVi7M-1NI/AAAAAAAB5F8/5zsjQZdaOn4/s1600/IMG_20150408_153732.jpg" height="640" width="640" /></a><br /><br />By default, OS X does not have such functionality. Interestingly enough, my Ubuntu Linux machines has them working by default, same as Windows.<br /><br />So I did some googling and came across this article:&nbsp;<a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/110177/logitech-mouse-how-can-i-use-additional-buttons">Logitech Mouse: how can I use additional buttons?</a><br /><br />There's a app called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.boastr.de/">BetterTouchTool</a>&nbsp;that lets you customize and map both of these buttons to forward and back.<br /><br />Just download and install the app and here's what you need to do:<br /><br />Open BetterTouchTool app and it should prompt you to change a Security &amp; Privacy settings to allow the app to work.<br /><br />Under <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">System Preferences -&gt; Security &amp; Privacy -&gt; Privacy</span>, click on <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Accessibility</span>&nbsp;tab and <b>enable</b> <b>BetterTouchTool.app</b>&nbsp;from the list on the right.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GMV5qgREdR8/VSWW-KSh7gI/AAAAAAAB5Gc/8AMdbUeG850/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-04-08%2Bat%2B4.00.23%2BPM.png"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GMV5qgREdR8/VSWW-KSh7gI/AAAAAAAB5Gc/8AMdbUeG850/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-04-08%2Bat%2B4.00.23%2BPM.png" height="520" width="640" /></a><br /><br />From there, you'll then be able to add the mappings by selecting Normal Mice on the top, then click on Add New Button. On the bottom left, select a mouse button by actually clicking it, then in the Custom Keyboard Shortcut section, press the Command&nbsp;+ Left Arrow or Command + Right arrow&nbsp;buttons on the keyboard to add the mappings to the corresponding mouse buttons. It should look like the screenshot below.<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tmt2CaMYbhQ/VSWYMSg-ktI/AAAAAAAB5Go/c2Uw4Y6TDSA/s1600/Screen_Shot_2015-04-08_at_3_51_08_PM.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tmt2CaMYbhQ/VSWYMSg-ktI/AAAAAAAB5Go/c2Uw4Y6TDSA/s1600/Screen_Shot_2015-04-08_at_3_51_08_PM.jpg" height="464" width="640" /></a><br /><br />And that's it! Now in your web browser you'll have back and forward shortcuts working!<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Download at:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.boastr.de/">BetterTouchTool</a></span><br /><br />
