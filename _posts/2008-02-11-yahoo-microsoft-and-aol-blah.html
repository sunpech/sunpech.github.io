So it seems <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/02/09/1812239">Yahoo will reject Microsoft's Bid</a>, but now <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSL1164099920080211">Yahoo seeks to restart merger talk with AOL</a>?  Come on.  Not a single combination of these three companies will add much value to the end users, us.  The strategies would really be in cutting out the extra fat from a duplicate service(s) and in getting another stream of advertisement revenue from the merger.<br /><br />Now, a real merger/partnership that would add value would be in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a>.  This would totally make sense.  Great for the companies as well as for the consumers.  Although it would be a bit scary of how they would then have a monopoly of online sales.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5165656251934316114" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/R7AY_ghSFlI/AAAAAAAAAeo/rJDCtIehFZw/s200/amazon_ebay.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center;" /></div>
