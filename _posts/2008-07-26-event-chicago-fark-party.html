<a href="http://www.fark.com/">Fark</a> is having a little get-together in August over at <a href="http://www.lincolntaproom.com/">Lincoln Tap Room</a>.  See the <a href="http://forums.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments.pl?IDLink=3749173">Chicago Fark Party Thread</a>.<br /><br /><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Hang on to your hats, it's summertime in Chicago and that can mean one thing, time for another huge Chicago Fark Party!<br /><br />Mark your calendars for Saturday, August 16th, at THE LINCOLN TAP ROOM for the spot to be for the next huge Windy City blowout! We've had parties here before and it's always been a hit, and we have lined up a ridiculous party package again, so come on out and join us! Here are all the wicked grisly details.<br /><br />WHEN:<br />Saturday, August 16th<br />8pm-12am, or whenever you feel like showing up and leaving<br /><br />WHERE:<br />Lincoln Tap Room<br />3010 N. Lincoln Ave.<br />Chicago, IL 60657<br /><br />DETAILS:<br /><br />Lincoln Tap is a laid back bar with a nice beer selection and full liquor bar. We will have the entire back room reserved for us as well. Lincoln Tap Room is located on the triple intersection of Lincoln, Wellington, and Southport Aves. You can get there by the CTA's Brown Line by getting off at Wellington and walking West the six blocks or so to this intersection.<br /><br />PARTY PACKAGE DETAILS:<br /><br />We've done this before, so it's being lined up again, we've secured a party package for the date of the party. $40 will get you a complete open bar for 4 hours from 8pm to Midnight. That's right, for only $10 an hour, you can choose from any beer bottled or on draft, any mixed drink, any wine on the menu and it is all included! This deal is spectacular and I highly recommend you take advantage of it, but IT IS NOT REQUIRED FOR ENTRY, the special is just there if you wish to partake of it.</span>(Source: <a href="http://forums.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments.pl?IDLink=3749173">fark</a>)</blockquote>
