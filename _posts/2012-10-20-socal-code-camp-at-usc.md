Last weekend I attended <a href="http://www.socalcodecamp.com/">SoCal Code Camp</a> held at <a href="http://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a> (USC). Had a good time learning about new stuff as usual. The prizes here are pretty spectacular, but once again I won absolutely nothing. Nothing!

Like the one I went to earlier this year, this one was also a bit heavy on the .Net side of technology with little representation from Android and iOS, and nothing from Ruby/Rails/Java/etc. Not that I'm saying it's the organizer's fault or anything, they actually did a great job. Sometimes I wonder if other tech communities here in Los Angeles care to organize something under one event/banner at all, as each tend to have their own community to care for. Oh well right?
