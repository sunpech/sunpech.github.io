I picked up a free ticket to <a href="http://mobilecampla.com/">Mobile Camp LA</a> earlier this week and decided to attend. Overall I wasn't too impressed with the event. It may have very well been the first of it's kind aimed at developers, designers, and business folk. Anyway, I thought the venue was a bit of a mess as many things went wrong.
<ol>
  <li>Earthquake drill at 10:15am (slightly distracting, but out of their control-- I understand)</li>
  <li>A lot of sessions held in a one big open space separated by cloth dividers. Too noisy!</li>
  <li>Microphone problems-- couldn't hear some sessions at all!</li>
  <li>Power outages-- no presentation slides or projectors!</li>
  <li>Cancelations and running behind time (somewhat normal, but there seemed to be quite a few).</li>
</ol>

Anyway, it was still enjoyable and I shouldn't complain since it was free for me. 
One more complaint in general, here was one session I ended up not enjoying where the speaker was more interested in promoting his own product than talking about technology or problem solving. I just do not like sitting through some kind of product advertisement for an hour.

The interesting thing I walked away with was how many new products/services Adobe was coming out with for not just designers, but also developers. Check out <a href="http://html.adobe.com/">html.adobe.com</a> to see all these brand new stuff. They are definitely pushing the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud.html">Creative Cloud</a>. Something I'll have to keep my eye on since I use Photoshop and Lightroom pretty heavily these days.
