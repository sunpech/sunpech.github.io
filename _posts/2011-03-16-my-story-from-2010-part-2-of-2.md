This is part 2 of 2 of my story from 2010. You can view part 1 at: <a href="/2011/03/my-story-from-2010-part-1-of-2">My Story from 2010 (Part 1 of 2)</a>

So where I last left off, I was leaving Chicago, destination: Thailand. Below, the bags I packed at O'hare International Airport.

I was flying <a href="http://www.koreanair.com/">Korea Air</a> for the first time. On my way to Bangkok, Thailand, I had a layover at S. Korea. Some pictures I took at the airport:

Below I have pictures I took in Bangkok in November and December 2010. Many nights out with friends, family at restaurants, Siam Paragon, Central World, and Bangkok's first F1 demo at Democracy Monument.

Some pictures in Chiang Mai with my family. We had <i>tum-boon</i> (merit-making) ceremony at my grandmother's house. It was a nice gathering of my mom's family.

Also went to a park, a Night Safari (zoo), and flower garden with my mom and her nursing school friends. I took a ton of pictures of the animals on the safari.

I also went to do <i>loy-krathong</i> for a few nights. I have some nice shots of the sky lanterns out in a field. Took a lot of pictures on these festivities and parade.

This was my first time in Bangkok's Yaowarat (the street that Chinatown is on). I ate at a ton of places and the weather, best of all, wasn't too hot.

As maybe you can tell, I cancelled my return trip scheduled for December 8, 2010. I was having such a blast in Thailand that I felt that I couldn't leave just yet. Korean Air said that I have one year to use my return trip, and that I can schedule it anytime as long as a seat was available.

What's keeping me here is not just food and family as you might have guessed. I've met some wonderful people here through random encounters at meetings, user groups, twitter, and I just really want to keep learning new things and pushing myself in positive directions for my life.

This concludes this two part blog series of my story from 2010.
