I just got back from my first <a href="http://www.nba.com/bulls">Chicago Bulls</a> game.  I have to admit, I haven't been a good fan to the Bulls in a long time.  Not since the 90's dynasty have I ever sat down to watch a full game, start to finish.  Best part of all, my tickets were free and the seats were pretty good (Section 228, Row 1, Seat 7), Club level seats.<br /><br />Tonight's game was against the Bucks.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Score:</span><br />Bulls 108<br />Bucks 95<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SQfidVJ6RtI/AAAAAAAAIP0/cPgSpFtEO8A/s1600-h/1225245689509.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5262423683128510162" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SQfidVJ6RtI/AAAAAAAAIP0/cPgSpFtEO8A/s400/1225245689509.jpg" style="cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; height: 300px; width: 400px;" /></a>
