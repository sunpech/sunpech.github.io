Last week I drove from Los Angeles back to my hometown of Chicago. I've moved back home for personal reasons. It took my sister and I nine days to get across the US-- mostly just eating, driving, sleeping, and taking pictures.<br /><br />The states I drove through were (in order):<br /><ol><li>California</li><li>Arizona</li><li>Utah</li><li>Colorado</li><li>Kansas</li><li>Missouri</li><li>Illinois</li></ol><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qBBZTqYZz-8/VHbtQnX5ziI/AAAAAAAB0nY/sJXuGH_3zSE/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-11-27%2Bat%2B3.20.55%2BAM.png"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qBBZTqYZz-8/VHbtQnX5ziI/AAAAAAAB0nY/sJXuGH_3zSE/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-11-27%2Bat%2B3.20.55%2BAM.png" height="356" width="640" /></a><br /><br /><b>The first half of the trip from California to Colorado was rather scenic and interesting</b>. This is where I actually took pictures.<br /><br /><b>The second half, from Kansas to Chicago was rather plain and boring</b>-- the terrain was just flat. For the most part my sister and I just pushed our way through the midwest with only stops for food and sleep. It didn't help that there was a lot of fog and rain through these parts.<br /><br /><h2>Pictures</h2><div>I didn't take too many pictures, as I was trying to balance between visiting interesting places for pictures and making good time for the drive. I experimented with taking a lot of panoramas and merging them together in Photoshop later.</div><div><br /></div><b>Road to Joshua Tree</b> (California)<br />Buy Print:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.500pxart.com/photo/90078701">http://www.500pxart.com/photo/90078701</a><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Q_cZmyiJL80/VHbqR4B2gzI/AAAAAAAB0nE/KdIE7rLKXZA/s1600/2014-11-16%2Bat%2B14-49-48.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Q_cZmyiJL80/VHbqR4B2gzI/AAAAAAAB0nE/KdIE7rLKXZA/s1600/2014-11-16%2Bat%2B14-49-48.jpg" height="360" width="640" /></a><br /><br /><b>Joshua Tree</b> (California)<br />Buy Print:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.500pxart.com/photo/89994783">http://www.500pxart.com/photo/89994783</a><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E3nn5fin3kM/VHbsfHXo4xI/AAAAAAAB0nQ/XYp86Dr_h9c/s1600/2014-11-15%2Bat%2B16-35-59.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E3nn5fin3kM/VHbsfHXo4xI/AAAAAAAB0nQ/XYp86Dr_h9c/s1600/2014-11-15%2Bat%2B16-35-59.jpg" height="194" width="640" /></a><br /><b><br /></b><b>Horseshoe Bend</b> (Arizona)<br />Buy Print:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.500pxart.com/photo/90205911">http://www.500pxart.com/photo/90205911</a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ix3TK42AEdk/VHbmEbmhP_I/AAAAAAAB0mw/fjLfhvdKoME/s1600/2014-11-18%2Bat%2B17-00-27.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ix3TK42AEdk/VHbmEbmhP_I/AAAAAAAB0mw/fjLfhvdKoME/s1600/2014-11-18%2Bat%2B17-00-27.jpg" height="360" width="640" /></a><br /><br /><b>Zion National Park - The Great White Throne</b> (Utah)<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fwB0AzAxCw4/VG6g-GedUAI/AAAAAAAB0iQ/YTtsSvAqZ7U/s1600/2014-11-19%2Bat%2B10-14-05.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fwB0AzAxCw4/VG6g-GedUAI/AAAAAAAB0iQ/YTtsSvAqZ7U/s1600/2014-11-19%2Bat%2B10-14-05.jpg" height="360" width="640" /></a><br /><br /><b>Garden of the Gods </b>(Colorado)<br />Buy Print:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.500pxart.com/photo/90471869">http://www.500pxart.com/photo/90471869</a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jPNS1AHTO80/VHbqEu5q-OI/AAAAAAAB0m8/E9jf1EFHve0/s1600/2014-11-21%2Bat%2B10-47-24.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jPNS1AHTO80/VHbqEu5q-OI/AAAAAAAB0m8/E9jf1EFHve0/s1600/2014-11-21%2Bat%2B10-47-24.jpg" height="200" width="640" /></a><br /><br />Here are my picture albums of <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/+StevenSuwatanapongched/albums/6083976830307007217">Zion National Park</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/+StevenSuwatanapongched/albums/6082550453084998769">Joshua Tree</a>.<br /><h3>Behind the Camera</h3><div>Here are a few behind the camera shots I took.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://horseshoebend.com/">Horseshoe Bend</a> was rather scary walking right up to the edge to get a clear shot of the canyon.

There's one stop I wish we had time for--&nbsp;<a href="http://navajonationparks.org/htm/antelopecanyon.htm">Antelope Canyon</a>. There were so many delays that I had to just cut this part out of the trip. <a href="http://www.nps.gov/jotr/">Joshua Tree</a>&nbsp;is another place I'd like to revisit and spend a night doing night photography in. As well as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nps.gov/zion/">Zion National Park</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>I got to see first hand that <b>America is a lot of different things</b>. I've spent most of my life living in or near big cities (Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, etc...). There is a very different part of America that exists betweens these cities where life is a little bit calmer and relaxed.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>If you ever feel tired of where you are in life and can afford the time to get away, <i>look to the open road</i>. America has plenty of adventures and interesting places to see.</b></div><div><br /></div>
