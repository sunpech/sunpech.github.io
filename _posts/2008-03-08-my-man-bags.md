I went on an online shopping spree earlier this week and bought some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manbag">Man bags</a> for myself.  I only bought 2, but from the set below, I'm showing 2 because I ordered the one on the left (the more green/olive color), but I received the one on the right (brownish/dark-green).  At first I was going to send it back, but I grew attached to the color and didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back.  This one is for when I want to pack my laptop to go.

Now, for my remaining purchase I bought myself a "Jack Sack".  It's basically the same man bag that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Bauer">Jack Bauer</a> uses in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)">24</a>.  Can you believe someone actually has a blog (<a href="http://thejacksack.blogspot.com/">jacksack.blogspot.com</a>) about it?  Amazing.  This one is for my general use, a book, magazines, some papers/folders, diffuse kits, and pens.  You know, the regular stuff.

Overall, I'm happy with my purchases.  These bags are nice and sturdy, and I'm ok with it getting a little dirty.  I've been mostly using my <a href="http://www.diesel.com/">Diesel</a> bag, but it's a fake my sister bought me from Thailand and it's starting to wear down.
