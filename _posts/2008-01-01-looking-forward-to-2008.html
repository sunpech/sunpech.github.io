As 2007 comes to a close, it marks the end of one year, and the beginning of another.  So too does it bring an end more or less of my blogging on <a href="http://spong.org">spong.org</a>.  It was a personal side project of I started 9 years ago before blogs and other free services were available.  Now I'm reading to officially say that I'm stopping development on it as I have other things in my life I wish to focus on.  I do plan on keeping the spong.org domain and hosting, but the vaporware known as spongblog 2.0 is closed.<br /><br />The biggest reason behind this decision is that there are just too many other services that scale much better than whatever free hosting service I use (whether it be 1&1, godaddy, or discountasp.net).  I'm looking to downgrade my service plan to save money, once I have properly migrated all the old posts to static HTML pages.<br /><br />Anyway, <a href="http://sunpech.blogspot.com">sunpech.blogspot.com</a> will be my new blog going forward.
