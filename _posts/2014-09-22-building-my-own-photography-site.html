A few weeks ago my <a href="http://www.smugmug.com/">SmugMug</a> account expired and I didn't bother to renew it. This is where my photography website, <b>Sunpech Photography</b>, used to be hosted. I wasn't fully utilizing it to make sales nor was I pushing it very much to friends, family, and even clients. So I couldn't justify spending any money on it when I'd rather make sales on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.500px.com/">500px</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.500pxart.com/">500px Art</a>.<br /><br />Surprisingly my account was discontinued almost immediately and I whipped up a decent site in less than 24 hours along with appropriate DNS changes just so I didn't have an ugly 404 page.<br /><h3>Motivations</h3>Besides saving money I have other motivations to building my own site almost from scratch.<br /><br />I felt I could build my own photography site the way I wanted it-- for basically free. So in a matter of a few days I completed a lot of what I wanted using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a>. With TB the site is well equipped to be mobile and tablet friendly.<br /><br />I've been promoting sales on 500px Art, but that may change in the future. With 500px going through <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/15/500px-co-founder-and-former-ceo-ousted-from-the-startup/">some internal changes recently</a>, I need to protect any SEO karma I've built. I want to be able to simply change the buy print link en masse rather than fixing them one by one-- which I have to do for this blog.<br /><h3>New Website</h3>I'm happy to announce that I have launched it in it's current state, which I deem ready for public consumption. I still have some features I want to add such as multi photo uploads, better social media linking, and client login. But at it's current build it's usable for my needs.<br /><br />My renovated photography site:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sunpechphotography.com/">http://www.sunpechphotography.com</a><br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DcEc78CPGso/VCCr3RR5oxI/AAAAAAABxhw/EhVWFgp_I1A/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-22%2Bat%2B4.07.52%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DcEc78CPGso/VCCr3RR5oxI/AAAAAAABxhw/EhVWFgp_I1A/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-22%2Bat%2B4.07.52%2BPM.png" height="640" width="608" /></a><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Screenshot of the new photography site</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><br />
