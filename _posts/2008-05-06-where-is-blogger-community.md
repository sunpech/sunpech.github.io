I recently started a new blog over at <a href="http://www.vox.com">Vox.com</a> after my older sister recommended me the site after a friend of hers recommended it to her.  It's a social blogging website that emphasizes on the concept of a neighborhood; essentially socializing with other people with common interests, etc.

Anyway, I still really like <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>, but where the heck is the community?  I'm sure I can search for it through Google, but can't there be some kind of interface that can help users find each other?

I am quite disappointed.  Blogger is simple, straightforward, and customizable, but it lacks web 2.0's social aspect.  It's just a blogging service.  I have no plans to stop blogging here, but Vox does look interesting...

Anyway, here is the address to my Vox blog:

<a href="http://sunpech.vox.com">sunpech.vox.com</a>

Vox is created by <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a> (also the creators of <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">MoveableType</a>, <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a>, and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com">HuffingtonPost</a>).  Yes, that is quite the resume.
