When I found out that <a href="http://blog.bitbucket.org/2011/10/03/bitbucket-now-rocks-git/">BitBucket added support for Git</a>, I got pretty excited.<br /><br />Just this past year I started to use <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> as my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control">DVCS</a> for all my projects. More importantly, my older projects didn't have any version control whatsoever. They were projects spread across multiple computers that only merged into a single external USB hard drive when I started to retire some computers because they were just too old (six plus years!).<br /><br />Anyway, when this external drive began to make noises (clicking sounds), I decided I wanted to have my old projects stored in the cloud in case the the hard drive should ever fail.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.github.com/">Github</a> was my goto host as it was immensely popular. At first I was on the free plan (unlimited public repos), but I decided my ugly legacy code shouldn't be public, and went with their&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/plans">micro plan</a>&nbsp;($7 per month for 5 private repos).&nbsp;These projects are retired and there is no plan for future development. I just want them hosted with my other active personal projects.<br /><br />I signed up for <a href="http://www.bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> not too long ago just because I wanted to play with <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a>. That didn't last very long. But with the new additional support for Git, and with the free unlimited private and personal projects, I knew I wanted to add this as a remote to also host all my projects.<br /><br />But how was I to add another remote since I was already using Github? I wanted to add BitBucket as a remote along with Github.&nbsp;With a simple search on <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>, I came across&nbsp;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/849308/pull-push-from-multiple-remote-locations/3195446#3195446">pull/push from multiple remote locations</a>&nbsp;(answer).<br /><br />Here is an example <strong>.git/config</strong> setting, with the bolded text the example text to add a remote:<br /><blockquote><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">[core]</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; repositoryformatversion = 0</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; filemode = true</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bare = false</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; logallrefupdates = true</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ignorecase = true</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">[branch "master"]</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; remote = origin</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; merge = refs/heads/master</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">[remote "origin"]</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; url = git@github.com:sunpech/project_foo.git</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>url = git@bitbucket.org:sunpech/project_foo.git</strong></span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">[remote "heroku"]</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; url = git@heroku.com:project_foo.git</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/heroku/*</span></blockquote>Now when I push changes, it pushes it to both Github and BitBucket. Simple, and it works.&nbsp;Hope this helps.<br /><br />Of course you'll still need to set up the project on each respective host, in which case I'll point you to this&nbsp;<a href="http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git/">Github setup tutorial</a>&nbsp;(also see&nbsp;<a href="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Using+SSH+to+Access+your+Bitbucket+Repository">Using SSH to Access your Bitbucket Repository</a>).<br /><br />I have this setup because I may choose to abandon my Github pay account, and just host my public repos there, and all my private repos on BitBucket-- saving me $7/month. Plus, I think it's great for Github to have competition.
