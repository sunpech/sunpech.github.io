I'm back in Los Angeles now from traveling to cities like Toronto, San Francisco, and Chicago the past few months. I've been using <a href="http://500px.com/">500px</a> to research nice locations for these photos and it's really paid off-- I'm very happy.

If you haven't noticed, I've been pushing my <a href="http://500px.com/sunpech">500px account</a> for my photos. I'll have a separate blog post on that soon too, once a print I ordered arrives so I can give it a more thorough review. What I really like is that I get a 35% discount for ordering my own prints, which makes sense since they're mine. But some friends/family have been asking me what print material they should go for-- again, I'll give my thoughts on that in a future blog post.

I recently bought a shutter release remote cable for my DSLR. Specifically, it's the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KDS2BY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002KDS2BY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sunpech-20">SMDV Remote Shutter Release Cable</a>. So far, it's been really good. It holds in place well and does what it's supposed to.

I'm starting to do more long exposures now and and less HDR shots. I'm finding that I like there to be lit and unlit sections to a photo or piece of art. I don't need the dark areas to be super detailed and lit up. That's my quick thought.

Here are my photos:

#### Downtown Los Angeles
