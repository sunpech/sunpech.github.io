I've had my <a href="http://www.t-mobileg1.com/">G1</a> for a few weeks now.  My overall impressions are pretty good.  I like the touch screen, I like the free applications available through the market app, and I definitely enjoy the web browsing experience on the 3G network over my old Blackberry Pearl on the EDGE network.<br /><br /><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267257220442964562" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SRkOiO0dQlI/AAAAAAAAIWA/FOxhihLlYQA/s400/g1officialnewnew.jpg" /><br /><br />But I do have a few complaints:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Battery Life is too short</span>.  I can maybe go for a maximum of 2 days without a recharge if I very minimal use of the phone.  But I suppose this is understandable since it is 3G and touchscreen.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">3G network still not available everywhere</span>.  I go to the Chicago suburbs, and I'm back on the EDGE network when I want to browse.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Facebook's regular website is not G1 friendly</span>.  This is not the G1's fault.  In fact I use the Facebook iphone website instead.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gmail's contact does not sync well</span>.  This is what pisses me off the most.  Since your contact list is from your Gmail account (at least it should be for back-up purposes), it's a one way sync: Gmail app to phone.  If you enter a new contact in the phone, it will not sync up into the Gmail app, or at least not quickly.</li></ul>
