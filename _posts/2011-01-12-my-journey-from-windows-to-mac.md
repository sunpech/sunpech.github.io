So back in May of 2010, I bought myself a Macbook Pro.  I bought it for several reasons:

<ol>
  <li>I wanted a new toy/gadget to play with.</li>
  <li>I wanted to try the only other operating system (OS) I haven't really spent much time on (OS X).</li>
  <li>I wanted to get away from Microsoft technologies</li>
</ol>

Those were and are the 3 main reasons. 

It's been a little over 8 months of usage and I absolutely love it.  The hardware (battery and LCD) is fantastic, the OS is pretty-- but there's still a Unix OS (BSD to be specific) underneath it all.  I feel pretty much at home with the terminal command line from my Linux/Solaris days.  I've been using Microsoft technologies less and less since May 2010.  I will perhaps blog in the future as to <i>why</i> I'm moving away from Microsoft technologies.  Perhaps. 

Granted, I use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_Camp_(software)">Bootcamp</a> and <a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a> to run a copy of Windows 7 Ultimate with Visual Studio 2010, SQL Server 2008 Management Studio, and other various tools (ahem, Starcraft 2).  I find that I can be just as productive with my computing needs on a Mac. 

Some tools I absolutely love on my Macbook Pro: 

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://adium.im/">Adium</a> - Instant messenger for many chat services</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.apple.com/aperture/">Aperture</a> - Photo software comparable to Adobe Lightroom</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/">iWork</a> - Office/Productivity suite from Apple</li>
  <li><a href="http://getsongbird.com/">Songbird</a> - Music player (I still don't like iTunes)</li>
  <li><a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a> - The quintessential text editor for Mac (plugins listed below)</li>
  <ul>

  </ul>
  <li><a href="http://visor.binaryage.com/">Visor</a> - A Quake-style drop-down Terminal</li>
</ul>

I look forward to using my Macbook Pro more and more.  I'm not saying I'm never going to use Windows or Microsoft tech again, or that there's something wrong with it, it's just nice to work with other technologies for the time being. 

So here's to 2011, to learning new things!
