One evening I took my DSLR and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004PV8N1I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004PV8N1I&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sunpech-20">bokeh kit</a> with a heart-shaped cut out and took a walk down Miracle Mile. I started at LACMA and just walked east on Wilshire and snapped away at all the lights and traffic. I didn't care so much about ISO as I needed to take fast shots of varying lighting situations that came up on the street-- so I just stayed in auto-ISO.

The kit itself is just okay. I've had it for a few years now, but never shot with it that much. I find the plastic doesn't keep it's shape or hold that well on my Canon 50mm f/1.4 lens. It really only fits on a 58mm lens ring. I had to push the cut out against the lens filter for just about every shot to minimize any extra light coming in. I generally shot between f/1.4 and f/2 (aperture-priority mode of course) with as much out of focus as possible. I used manual focus to adjust for shape.
