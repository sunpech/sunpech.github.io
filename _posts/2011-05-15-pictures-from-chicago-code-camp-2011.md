Chicago Code Camp 2011 (CCC3) has wrapped up! I had a great time going to various sessions, learning new things, and meeting/talking with great people. I wish more of these events would take place in the Chicagoland area. I think about 300 people attended, which I think is pretty good considering the event wasn't even in Chicago! This year, CCC3 took place at <a href="http://www.clcillinois.edu/">College of Lake County</a>, in Grayslake, which is located about 50 miles from Chicago (approximately 1 hour drive).

I won a raffle prize at the end of the day, but I gave it away since I had no use for a teach-yourself Visual C# 2010 in 24 hours. Well, not just no use, but more importantly, no time either since I have a pile of books I need to get though still. I rather give it to someone who would use it rather than it sit on my bookshelf collecting dust. Funny bit: there was Programming Sharepoint book as a raffle prize that almost no one wanted.


I hope to get around to blogging about some of my thoughts related to some of the sessions soon enough. It'll have to wait a bit since later on today I will be heading out to <a href="http://www.railsconf.com/">Rails Conf</a> in Baltimore, Maryland. I'll be there May 15-19. I hope to rock out with my CCC3 shirt out there too.

As always, here are some of the pictures I took at Chicago Code Camp 2011. Full album <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/101693597219413173200/2011ChicagoCodeCamp">here</a>.
