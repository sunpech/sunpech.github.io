<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"> </span><br /><div>It was the summer of 2010 that I decided I wanted to dust off the DSLR I bought in 2006 and put it to good use more often. So throughout that summer, I made an effort to bring my camera with me everywhere I went. I brought it to work, to my various meetups I attended, and even when I walked around Chicago. I just kept taking photos of whatever I thought was interesting.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WuLnoARIQSA/TxVm8julanI/AAAAAAAA2qw/QJGYhDm_jo0/s1600/IMG_1101.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WuLnoARIQSA/TxVm8julanI/AAAAAAAA2qw/QJGYhDm_jo0/s1600/IMG_1101.jpeg" style="cursor: move;" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></div>I discovered that I really enjoyed taking photos and sharing them with everyone on my social networks. I felt that I wanted to share the things that were going on around me. From comic conventions, a friend's night out, someone presenting at a meetup or conference, or the food I was eating-- I enjoy publishing it for all the world to see.<br /><br /><strong>I've realized that photography, like blogging, is a form of story-telling.</strong>&nbsp;<em>At least that's how I like to photograph</em>. It's no surprise then that photography would become one of my new favorite hobbies. Like writing/blogging, photography is a craft I want to get better at.&nbsp;I recently came across a blog post:&nbsp;<a href="http://photofocus.com/2011/07/08/want-to-be-a-better-photographer-become-a-better-writer/">Want to be a Better Photographer? Become a Better Writer</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/scottbourne">Scott Bourne</a>. That post points out that all these things have a strong correlation.<br /><br />But it also occurred to me recently, that coding has a lot of similarities to photography and blogging.<br /><strong>Software development is basically a form of communication.&nbsp;</strong>I am reminded of the post:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/11/coding-its-just-writing.html">Coding: It's Just Writing</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/codinghorror">Jeff Atwood</a>.&nbsp;<strong>When a developer writes code, it's basically writing.</strong>&nbsp;The developer communicates to the computer, what the developer wants the computer to do, in the form of code. A developer also communicates to other developers, project managers, and clients verbally, through emails, or even instant messages. Check out&nbsp;<a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/">Jon Skeet's</a>&nbsp;answer to&nbsp;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/477310/are-good-programmers-good-writers/477319#477319">Are good programmers good writers?</a>&nbsp;I very much agree with his statement:<br /><em><br /></em><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><em>"clear thinking leads to clear code" </em>- Jon Skeet&nbsp;</blockquote>I must thank <a href="http://www.stackoverflow/">Stackoverflow</a>, for helping developers to combine writing and coding together. For me, the very act of writing out a question on any of the <a href="http://www.stackexchange.com/">StackExchange</a>&nbsp;(SE) sites, helps me get closer to finding an answer. To write a question so that others could answer, requires thinking and organization. It needs to be concise, show effort, and it has to be clear. There were probably a dozen or so questions I was going to post on some of these SE sites, that I ended up answering on my own because I sat down to clearly think and write what I needed help on. <em>Of course I didn't bother posting the question once I figured out the answer, but in hindsight, I guess I should have.</em><br /><em><br /></em><br />So in essence, photography, blogging, coding are all forms of story-telling and writing. They provide a means to achieve clarity. I really enjoy doing all of the above. What's awesome about it is, there's no <em>done-learning</em> to any of them. You can just keep doing them for months, years, even decades, and still find ways to improve and enjoy the art.</div>
