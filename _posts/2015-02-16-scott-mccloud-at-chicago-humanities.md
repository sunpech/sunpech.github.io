This past Friday the <a href="http://chicagohumanities.org/">Chicago Humanities Festival</a> had <a href="http://scottmccloud.com/">Scott McCloud</a> at the <a href="http://www.artic.edu/">Art Institute</a>. Not many of my friends and family know that Mr. McCloud was a big influence during my teenage and high school years.

Back in the nineties, I was a big comic book reader. Besides being a reader, I also loved doodling and drawing. But after a while, I wanted to know more about the history, art, and motivations of the comic book creators. That's when I picked up reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006097625X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=006097625X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkId=B3N7BL7ANOJYPEPZ">Understanding Comics</a>, where my mind just opened up and just saw things in a new way.

It was through Scott's writings that I had a huge appreciation to the arts and story-telling. Thank you Scott, for your past, present, and future work which woke up the artist/creator inside of me.

The event itself was really nice. I got special permission to take photos. A lot of people showed up, probably around three hundred people were in the Arthur Rubloff Auditorium off Columbus. The conversation between Lynne Thomas and Scott was excellent. I also really liked Scott's short presentation on how he creates his work in Photoshop. After the chat, Scott also had a book signing.

Here is the <a href="http://chicagohumanities.org/events/2015/winter/scott-mccloud">event link</a>. Here is the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.837394669658892.1073741883.408588035872893&amp;type=1">full album of photos</a>.
