<div style="text-align: left;">The first two weeks this month I attended several Chicago user group meetings and events. &nbsp;I wanted to recap my experience with many of them since it was my first time attending several of the events.</div><br /><b>Tuesday March 2, 2010 (</b><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Chicago-APM/"><b>Chicago Agile Project Management Meetup Group</b></a><b>)</b><br />I've been a member of this meetup group for a while now. &nbsp;I really made an effort to attend this one since the topic was on <i>estimating projects</i>. &nbsp;I've read several books and articles on Agile principles, but never have I come across how to estimate the time.<br /><br />I was impressed with the professionals that showed up to contribute and discuss in an "un-meeting" sort of way. &nbsp;There was a general presentation given by&nbsp;Glenn Bernsohn, which was fantastic, but the really interesting points came from the project managers in attendance.<br /><br />Free Pizza and Pop: Yes.<br /><br /><b>Wednesday March 3, 2010 (</b><a href="http://chicagosilverlight.eventbrite.com/"><b>The Chicago Silverlight Users Group</b></a><b>)</b><br />I honestly didn't know about this event until I checked&nbsp;<a href="http://davebost.com/blog/2010/03/04/resources-from-silverlight-4-presentation/">Dave Bost's blog post</a>&nbsp;that very morning on Google Reader. &nbsp;I RSVP'd right away. &nbsp;I'm glad I did too, as by the time I got to work it was a sold out event (it was free, but the seat count was at capacity already).<br /><br />Dave presented on&nbsp;<a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight 4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience comprised mostly of developers and designers. &nbsp;It made me think, where exactly is the gap between Silverlight and WPF? &nbsp;Thin client versus thick client? &nbsp;I just really wanted to get back to web development as a <i>dev-signer</i> (as Dave called it-- a hybrid of developer/designer).<br /><ul><li><a href="http://twitpic.com/16h8zw">Twitpic of the pizza Microsoft bought us</a></li></ul>Free Pizza and Pop: Yes.<br /><br /><b>Thursday March 4, 2010 (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/angelab/archive/2010/02/23/brian-harry-speaking-at-clarity-consulting-in-chicago-in-march.aspx">Visual Studio 2010 and Team Foundation Server 2010 - Presented by Microsoft Fellow, Brian Harry</a>)</b><br />I was able to leave work early to attend this event. &nbsp;Besides learning about features in the upcoming VS 2010 and TFS, Brian talked about this days when he helped developVisual SourceSafe back in 1994.<br /><ul><li><a href="http://twitpic.com/16mobu">Twitpic of the pizza</a></li></ul>Free Pizza and Pop: Yes.<br /><br /><b>Friday March 5, 2010 (<a href="http://www.cloudcamp.org/chicago">Chicago Cloud Camp</a>)</b><br />I was only able to attend the Executive Panel event since there was an event conflict for Saturday's event. &nbsp;Overall impressed with the networking event prior to the panel discussion. &nbsp;In a nutshell, the panelists were all agreeing with Oracle CEO, Larry Ellison's rant on how cloud computing is nothing new and is a buzzword.<br /><br />The best description of cloud services given by the panel were: <b>As-a-service, Self-service, and Metering</b>.<br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"></span><br /><div><ul><li><a href="http://www.cloudcamp.org/chicago/2010-03-05" target="_blank">CloudCamp Chicago Executive Panel, Mar 5, 2010</a></li><li><a href="http://www.cloudcamp.org/chicago/2010-03-06" target="_blank">CloudCamp Chicago, Mar 6, 2010</a></li><li><a href="http://twitter.com/sunpech/status/10050491851">My Tweet on Panelists discussion</a></li></ul><ul></ul></div>Free Pizza and Pop: No. &nbsp;But there was alcohol and snacks during happy-hour before the event. &nbsp;And the after-set at Boston Blackies was awesome too.<br /><br /><b>Saturday March 6, 2010 (</b><a href="http://www.dayofmobile.com/"><b>Day Of Mobile</b></a><b>)</b><br />My favorite event I attended these first two weeks. &nbsp;I paid $30 for the all day event at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) at 3201 South State Street.<br /><br />I didn't wake up in time for most of the morning events. &nbsp;I got there a little bit before 11am and attended&nbsp;<i>Connecting your apps to the cloud: mobile CMS</i>, which I thought was okay, but I was really expecting more out of it. &nbsp;It seemed a bit more of a presentation of the company's services rather than the topic of cloud computing in relation to mobile apps. &nbsp;In the afternoon I hit up&nbsp;<i>Multimedia on the Android platform </i>by Jason Shah, which I enjoyed as it gave me a short into into Android development.<br /><br />By far my favorite two presentations were by Uncle Bob Martin (<i>Dynamic Langauges are the future</i>) and Jay Freeman (keynote:&nbsp;<i>Navigating through the politics of the mobile development community</i>) towards the end of the day. &nbsp;Does Uncle Bob ever do a presentation where he doesn't ask what&nbsp;avogrado's number is? &nbsp;Jay Freeman has so much knowledge and experience in the mobile development, it was a little difficult to absorb all that he had to say in one sitting.<br /><br />This event was possible thanks to <a href="http://www.techinthemiddle.com/">Tech In the Middle</a>. &nbsp;I look forward to their event in September when they bring together mobile and cloud services as the main topic.<br /><ul><li><a href="http://twitpic.com/1710o3">Twitpic of Uncle Bob Martin's presentation on Dynamic Languages</a></li><li><a href="http://twitpic.com/1715ke">Twitpic of Jay Freeman's keynote</a></li></ul><ul></ul>Free Pizza and Pop: No. &nbsp;But breakfast and lunch were served (included as part of admission).<br /><br /><b>Wednesday March 10, 2010 (<a href="http://chicagoalt.net/">Chicago Alt.net</a>)</b><br /><a href="http://www.just3ws.com/">Mike Hall</a> gave the presentation:&nbsp;<a href="http://chicagoalt.net/event/March-2010-Meeting-Introduction-to-Rake-with-Albacore-NET">Introduction to Rake with Albacore.NET</a>. &nbsp;Although it's not something my current company could use, it's always a pleasure to see/hear what other developers/companies are doing to get their work done.<br /><ul><li><a href="http://twitpic.com/17t9xc">Twitpic of Mike giving presentation</a></li></ul>Free Pizza and Pop: Yes.<br /><b><br /></b><br /><b>Upcoming Events:</b><br /><ul><li>Thursday March 25, 2010 (<a href="http://chicago.twestival.com/">Chicago Twestival</a>)</li><li>Tuesday April 13, 2010 (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Chicago-APM/calendar/12762946/">Chicago Agile Project Management April Meetup</a>)</li></ul><ul></ul>
