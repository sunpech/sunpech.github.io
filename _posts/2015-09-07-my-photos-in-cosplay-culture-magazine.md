Last week, the Halloween edition of [Cosplay Culture magazine](http://www.cosplayculture.com/) came out on newsstands. There is an article on [San Diego Comic Con](http://www.comic-con.org/cci) that features my photos in it. *The article is a ten whopping page spread!* This all started from a simple comment on an [instagram photo](https://instagram.com/p/4-9toeQR7z/).

You can find this magazine at Barnes and Noble, Target, Walmart, Ralph's, Walgreens, CVS, and other major newsstands and comic shops. I found my copies at B&N.

### Thank you cosplayers

Whenever I work on photos from conventions, I do my best to identify the cosplayer(s) in them and tag them properly when I post them to Facebook, Instagram, or any other social media outlet. It does help when commenters help me tag people or if I get their business card.

I want to give credit to these cosplayers for letting me take their photo at comic con. These are the cosplayers that appear in the article.
