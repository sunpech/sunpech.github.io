For the past seven months I've jumped back into reading comics and graphic novels. I used to read them a lot when I was a teenager, but just lost interest by the mid/late 1990s. I find myself struggling to enjoy reading monthly issues and going to the comic book shop every week-- or even getting them online via <a href="http://www.comixology.com/">Comixology</a>.

The problem I have is that I don't like reading them month to month-- it's too little to read bit by bit. I prefer reading a story arc in a sitting or two. My taste is turning more towards graphic novels and/or completed series-- just like I did when I was a teenager.

<i>Don't worry, this review is spoiler-free.</i>

So I recently finished reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_K._Vaughan">Brian K. Vaughan</a>'s and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pia_Guerra">Pia Guerra's</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y:_The_Last_Man">Y: The Last Man</a> graphic novel series. I really enjoyed the books. The story is pretty solid and artwork pretty consistent.

This is how I would sum it up:

<blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>The story is about the world where one day, all the men and animals with a Y chromosome drop dead, except for one guy, Yorick Brown. This is his journey through a world with only women in charge. </i></blockquote>

It's got a bit of romance, science fiction, adventure, politics, action, and all around good story-telling. Each volume has 100+ pages, and I generally read about two volumes at a time. This book does involve adult content, so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under the age of seventeen. By movie standards, it's R-rated.

That said, there are certain parts-- or rather characters hard to believe in. Just some. It nags at my brain a bit, but I generally suspend disbelief and let it go. A few chapters does jump around a bit to the past a bit, so readers should keep in mind the numerous characters.

They are available in hardcovers too, but I just prefer softcover format because it's lighter to carry around and read, especially in bed.

I can see this graphic novel being adapted into a TV show. Maybe HBO or Starz can pick it up? I can see this kind of story compete against True Blood or even The Walking Dead. The drama is that good. 

If you enjoy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kirkman">Robert Kirkman</a>'s <a href="http://www.thewalkingdead.com/">The Walking Dead</a> comic series (currently ongoing) and other post-apocalyptic stories, you should give Y: The Last Man a try.
