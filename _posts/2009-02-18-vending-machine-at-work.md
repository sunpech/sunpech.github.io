This is my vending machine at work.  I happen to like Reeses Peanut Butter Cups.  I don't have a sweet tooth, but it's the only snack in the entire machine I would buy.

Can you see what's wrong?

<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SZzbaX6EZ2I/AAAAAAAAIks/UHThbD6zBb0/s1600-h/vending_machine.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5304355707276257122" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SZzbaX6EZ2I/AAAAAAAAIks/UHThbD6zBb0/s400/vending_machine.jpg" /></a>

It's behind a 100 Grand, one of the worst pieces of candy in the entire machine.  I haven't enjoyed a 100 Grand since I was a kid, which is probably the age of the candy since everybody knows it's stale and gross.

I don't understand why the guy who restocked the machine would do this.  WHY?  There are other empty lanes.  Why mix a different product with another?  Especially one that doesn't sell well with one that does (I should know, I polished off the last of the Reeses Pieces earlier this year).
