I really enjoyed reading the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451648537?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;camp=213733&amp;creative=393185&amp;creativeASIN=1451648537&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;qid=1325418866&amp;sr=8-1">Steve Jobs</a> biography by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Walter-Isaacson/e/B000APFLB8/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1">Walter Isaacson</a>. I bought both the hardcover and the Kindle book version. Isaacson's writing is superb and flows very well. However, if you read articles or even watched some Steve Jobs documentaries, it covers a lot of similar ground. I am reminded of the TV movie, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168122/">Pirates of Silicon Valley</a>. If you haven't watched it, I highly recommend it.

I think it's fair for people to compare him to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison">Thomas Edison</a>, as Jobs was <em>our</em> modern day inventor and businessman-- a visionary if you will. Perhaps it's a stretch to even consider him an inventor as he was more of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovator">innovator</a>. I personally find that Jobs gets a little too much credit, considering all the people he <em>used</em> and collaborated with, to get Apple to achieve the success it's found today. That's something that does bother me. That and the fact that he was an asshole to quite a few people throughout his life. But I suppose, as humans, we're all assholes at some point in our lives.

<a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> does owe everything to this man and his vision. I consider Steve Jobs to be the greatest CEO to date. I think Apple today can survive without the business savvy of Jobs, but we'll see where they are at five years from now. I personally think Steve Jobs should have been Times Person of the Year 2011.
