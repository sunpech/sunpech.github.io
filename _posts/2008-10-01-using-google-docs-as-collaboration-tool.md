A few weeks ago I visited San Francisco (SF) for the first time with my baby sister.  My sister was busy with law school, so the planning was mostly up to me, and I needed recommendations on what to do there.  So I started a <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> for myself at first and then added collaborators to help edit it.  These collaborators were all friends from SF.

It then turned into a wiki-style collaboration document.  I was getting recommendations on where to stay, where to go, what to eat.  It was great.  This simply goes to show the power of the Google's free collaboration tool and friends that are willing to help others.

Check out the result of the collaboration below:
