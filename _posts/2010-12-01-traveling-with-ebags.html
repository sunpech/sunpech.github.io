As many of you may or may not know, I've been traveling a lot lately. &nbsp;From July's trip to the San Diego Comic-Con, to September's All-You-Can-Jet pass, to even now, Thailand! &nbsp;It's been awesome, but there's a special shout-out I need to give recognition to:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ebags.com/">eBags.com</a><br /><br />On October 5, 2010, at the end of my All-You-Can-Jet vacationing, after hitting up 5 cities in one month, my main traveling bag: the&nbsp;Mother Lode eTech Junior 25 Wheeled Duffel, had ripped at the baggage claim at O'hare International Airport. &nbsp;I arrived home after one month of traveling, to have one of my bag handles ripped off!<br /><br />I really like the bags from eBags. &nbsp;They are wonderfully designed and super durable. &nbsp;I don't know how this bag was handled from Long Beach to Chicago, where a bag handle could be ripped off as such.<br /><br />See images below of what happened:<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/TPZiwLFT7yI/AAAAAAAAezo/5Rj8fo8H0Y0/s1600/IMG_20101005_164504.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/TPZiwLFT7yI/AAAAAAAAezo/5Rj8fo8H0Y0/s400/IMG_20101005_164504.jpg" height="301" width="400" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/TPZi4SiJRUI/AAAAAAAAezs/J6U-K8nuvh4/s1600/IMG_20101005_164513.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/TPZi4SiJRUI/AAAAAAAAezs/J6U-K8nuvh4/s400/IMG_20101005_164513.jpg" height="301" width="400" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/TPZi_QZSRpI/AAAAAAAAezw/j81Kv1yffz0/s1600/IMG_20101005_164527.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/TPZi_QZSRpI/AAAAAAAAezw/j81Kv1yffz0/s400/IMG_20101005_164527.jpg" height="301" width="400" /></a><br /><br />I tweeted it out, and the eBags twitter account actual caught sight of my tweet, and tweeted back that I should contact their support center to take care of the issue. &nbsp;Which I did. &nbsp;I emailed them with links to the pictures I took above, and they promptly replied back for me to call their warranty center. &nbsp;Which I did. &nbsp;I called them up and they pulled up my account. &nbsp;I was surprised to learn that they had documented my previous email with pictures, so our phone conversation was short. <br /><br />They said next time to contact O'hare for the damages, but since all bags made by eBags have a lifetime warranty, they were going to send me a replacement and to throw out the damaged bag! &nbsp;Awesome. &nbsp;I didn't even know my bag had a lifetime warranty. &nbsp;The replacement bag (same color, blue) came in the mail a few days later.<br /><br />A week or so after that, I ended up ordering the larger 29" (orange) for my trip to Thailand. &nbsp;And here from Bangkok, Thailand, I want to say thank-you to eBags for their great customer support. &nbsp;As you can see in the picture below, I have a nice set of eBags for my Thailand adventures<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/TPZjHudQV1I/AAAAAAAAez0/mb9JZfTmnYY/s1600/IMG_20101107_090206.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/TPZjHudQV1I/AAAAAAAAez0/mb9JZfTmnYY/s400/IMG_20101107_090206.jpg" height="400" width="301" /></a><br /><br />
