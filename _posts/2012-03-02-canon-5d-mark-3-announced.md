The <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/03/02/canon-announces-eos-5d-mark-iii-22-3mp-full-frame-sensor-6-fps/">Canon 5D Mark 3 was announced</a> yesterday.

I've been looking to get a full-frame DSLR for a while now. Last year I was thinking of getting the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G5ZTLS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001G5ZTLS">Canon 5D Mark 2</a> (M2), but <i>settled</i> for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040JHVCC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0040JHVCC">Canon 60D</a> because of price and I'd rather wait for the M3. Hopefully the M2 will drop in price <i>slightly</i> once the M3 officially comes out.

The price of the M3 is $3500. That's body only, no kit lens. Ouch. It's $1000 more than what the M2 body is priced at currently. As I've read, Canon will continue to manufacture the M2, which I think is good news, as it's still a great camera.

You can pre-order the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FGYZFI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007FGYZFI">Canon 5D Mark 3 (body only)</a> or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FGZ1V0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007FGZ1V0">Canon 5D Mark 3 with 24-105mm f/4 L lens</a> now.

What I look forward to the most about the M3 are the following:
<ol>
  <li>built-in HDR feature</li>
  <li>6fps</li>
  <li>Improved AF system from M2</li>
  <li>Support for SD and CF cards</li>
  <li>Better weather sealing than my current 60D</li>
  <li>Full-frame, of course</li>
</ol>

The <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/843008-USA/Canon_5175B002_EF_24_70mm_f_2_8L_II.html">Canon 24-70 f/2.8 II L lens is available for pre-order at B&amp;H</a>, currently priced at $2300. Another ouch. Besides what I read are improvements to it's predecessor, I like how it has an 82mm filter size. The exact size of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NP46K2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000NP46K2">Canon 16-35mm f/2.8 L lens</a>! Still though, I wish the new 24-70 would have IS built in. I think that would have made the price much more compelling.

So am I going to get the Canon 5D Mark 3?

I'm still undecided for now. It would be great to get the M2, since it's cheaper, but I don't like how it has only CF support-- no SD card. Having an SDHC slot is important to my workflow, as my Macbook Pro has a slot for that. I'd rather not buy a card reader to lug around.

I'm also much more interested in investing in a more flexible lens such as the 24-70 II than buying a new camera body. We'll see.
