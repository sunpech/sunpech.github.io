description: I give a spoiler free review of Ernest Cline's new book, Armada.
---

A few months ago I read [Ernest Cline](http://www.ernestcline.com/)'s book, [Ready Player One](http://readyplayerone.com/). I [blogged](/2015/06/ready-player-one) about my love for the book and how excited I was that a movie was being made. *Quick update, it's getting a [release date](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/steven-spielbergs-ready-player-one-813553) of December 15, 2017!* However, I can't say that I liked his second book, [Armada](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804137250/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0804137250&linkCode=as2&tag=sunpech-20&linkId=VXQGS6LWNWROQB2F), nearly as much.

**In a nutshell the book is [The Last Starfigther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Starfighter) meets [Ender's Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game).** It's a coming of age story of a teenager that plays video games, struggles with his place in the world, and has pop culture knowledge of things from the 80s forward. Sound familiar?

I get it that Cline loves video games and retro pop-culture from the 1980s, but it does seem that he name drops a lot of references for the sake of doing so. It's almost as if it's page filler. The result is a space adventure that is just okay and I could see being a short television series for one or two seasons. I don't think it's interesting enough to be a movie-- unless it gets some re-writes.

In short, if you are in your 30s or 40s, and are familiar with the book/movies I listed above, **this book doesn't add anything interesting to the sci-fi adventure genre**. *However, you may enjoy it if you're new to the genre.*
