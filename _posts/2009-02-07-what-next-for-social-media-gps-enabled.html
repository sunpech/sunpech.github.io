There are some really cool GPS applications out there that are about to push the boundaries of technology and social media as we know it.  I remember years ago when I shared a link to <a href="http://www.loopt.com">Loopt</a> with friends, pretty much everyone didn't like the idea of sharing that much information with each other.  Today, I already have a few friends jumping onto to use such an app.  Google has now also released a similar application out called <a href="http://www.google.com/latitude">Google Latitude</a>, but based on their Google login system.  I also just finished manually updating my G1 phone to use RC33, just so I could be one of the first to use the app.<br /><br />What I'm a little surprised about is how <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> doesn't have a social GPS application of their own.  Loopt already ties in to both Facebook and <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> status feeds.  But there is so much untapped potential with what can be done with users that choose to interact using these applications.  Imagine a service that is able to provide relevant ads or suggestions based on your location?  The sky is literally the limit to what can be achieved.<br /><br />Links:<ul><li><a href="http://www.blogsdna.com/2383/how-to-manually-update-t-mobile-g1-phone-firmware-to-rc33.htm">How to manually update T-Mobile G1 phone firmware to RC33</a></li></ul>
