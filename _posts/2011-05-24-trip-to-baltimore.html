I was out in Baltimore, Maryland for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.railsconf.com/">RailsConf</a>&nbsp;last week. The conference was great, but this was also the first time I've been in Baltimore other than for a flight layover. For the most part I was there for the 4 day conference and eating.<br /><br />I must say that some of the neighborhoods in the evening/night didn't feel to safe to walk through.&nbsp;Also, the taxis there are so very expensive! I paid $22 (including tip) for a taxi to drive four miles. I'll be sure to have food pictures up on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.foodishappiness.com/">FoodIsHappiness.com</a>&nbsp;soon enough.<br /><br />But this marks the end of my flying/adventuring for the time being. For the past month I've been on the plane 2-3 times per week, which has been tiring me out. I look forward to staying on the ground for a bit until I can make my way out to California.<br /><br />Here are a few of my favorite pictures:<br /><br />My busted bed when I arrived late Sunday night (no, I didn't break it...) <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-m2Js1R3pBLk/TdwEHwTmU1I/AAAAAAAAo38/KXGgdGHylxs/s1600/IMG_20110516_015143.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-m2Js1R3pBLk/TdwEHwTmU1I/AAAAAAAAo38/KXGgdGHylxs/s400/IMG_20110516_015143.jpg" height="300" width="400" /></a><br /><br />Harbor Place<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XZZh6elDims/TdH7dY5MSTI/AAAAAAAAoFk/-mHBMr9VVUc/s1600/2011-05-16+at+11-07-01.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XZZh6elDims/TdH7dY5MSTI/AAAAAAAAoFk/-mHBMr9VVUc/s400/2011-05-16+at+11-07-01.jpg" height="266" width="400" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WyEy4GOBkGU/TdH7f6bkjgI/AAAAAAAAoFw/-IoLv4LBeh0/s1600/2011-05-16+at+11-08-10.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WyEy4GOBkGU/TdH7f6bkjgI/AAAAAAAAoFw/-IoLv4LBeh0/s400/2011-05-16+at+11-08-10.jpg" height="266" width="400" /></a><br /><br />I thought this B&amp;N was super interesting.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iFcmrgACpus/TdH8GaG6vfI/AAAAAAAAoH8/NZap1pYIXjw/s1600/2011-05-16+at+18-57-07.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iFcmrgACpus/TdH8GaG6vfI/AAAAAAAAoH8/NZap1pYIXjw/s400/2011-05-16+at+18-57-07.jpg" height="266" width="400" /></a><br /><br />Hybrid buses.
