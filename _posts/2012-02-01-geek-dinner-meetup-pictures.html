Last night I checked out the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/LA-g33k-d1nner/events/48123562/">first g33k d1nner meetup</a>&nbsp;at <a href="http://goldenroad.la/">Golden Road Brewery</a>.<br /><br />I attend a lot of meetups every month. When I walk into a meetup, I generally won't know what kind of audience will be there. I may know the subject and/or the presentation(s) for the evening-- which is usually good enough for me to say yes or no to going.<br /><br />Last year, I <a href="http://www.sunpech.com/2011/07/barcamp-chicago-at-pumping-station-one.html">attended Chicago's Barcamp</a>. It was also a nice event. But I didn't feel compelled to stay for the day because the presentations for the day wasn't of great interest to me. And of course it was a really nice day outside.<br /><br />Anyway, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">barcamps</a>, like this geek dinner, I walked in not know exactly what I was going to see. As typical barcamp fashion, the event is what you make of it, or rather, what the audience makes of it-- completely. I now find myself asking if it was worth the nearly one-hour drive through LA rush hour to get there. It could be that I'm just a little socialed-out lately. Going forward, I prefer meetups with a specific agenda, where I know more information on what I'm getting myself into.<br /><br />I don't mean to say I had a bad time. I enjoyed the meetup. It's just that not all topics in conversations were of great interest all the time. I really do see myself enjoying more agenda-based meetups rather than something generic.<br /><br /><b>UPDATE</b>: Just realized that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randal_L._Schwartz">Randal L. Schwartz</a> was at the meetup last night!
