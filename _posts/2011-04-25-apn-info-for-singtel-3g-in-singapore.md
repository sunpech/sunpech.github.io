I wanted to write a quick post on my experience with getting a SIM card in Singapore.  
When I arrived to Changi Airport, I immediately went to get a SIM card from a money exchange booth. They seemed to only offer prepaid SIM cards in $50, $100, and $150 SGD if I'm not mistaken. Since I was only staying for 4 days, I chose the smallest one: $50 SGD.

After following the instructions, I was able to dial out. But most important to me was to get data. All they told me was to dial *363 to get 3G going. This was true, but they left out a vital piece of information. The APN info!  

I went back to ask what else was needed. After 5 minutes, I was able to convince the lady at the counter that it was probably the APN info that was missing. She took out a booklet and looked up that information, wrote it down on a scrap paper, and gave it to me.

### APN information:

After doing this, I was able to get 3G going on my Google Nexus One (N1).   
Don't you think this information should be given to EVERYONE when they get a Singtel card with a data plan?? I shouldn't have to ask for it!  
Other notes:  

<ul>
  <li>3G is pretty good in Singapore, it's most everywhere</li>
  <li>I had little problem tethering on my N1 with my Macbook Pro</li>
</ul>

Hope this post will help others out there.
