I got myself a new mp3 player, the <a type="amzn" asin="B000HZ9CCA">Sansa e280</a>.  I used to have an Apple iPod mini, but the battery life on that device was just horrible after less than one year.  I was thinking of getting a new Ipod, but I was sick of Apple's proprietary music format.  I love <a href="http://www.itunes.com/" target="_blank">iTunes</a>, but it's a bit bloated.  So now I use either plain old <a href="http://www.winamp.com/" target="_blank">winamp</a> or the relatively new open source, <a href="http://www.songbirdnest.com/" target="_blank">Songbird</a>.

What I love about my new toy is that I don't need any bloated program to copy music, videos, pictures, or other data formats onto my device.  I just drag and drop files in.  It's also inexpensive compared with the iPod and it's got a built in FM tuner!  Plus, on top of all that, as a technocrat, I'm starting to get sick of hearing about Steve Jobs and Apple.  Let's just say that I consider them over-rated.
