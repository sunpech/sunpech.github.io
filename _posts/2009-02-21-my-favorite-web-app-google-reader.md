<a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> is by far my favorite web application.  I reorganized many of the labels as well as added/deleted some feeds.  But I truly consider this app as my gateway to the Internet.  I have it set as a tab that always opens up in any of my browsers.

What makes it my favorite is that it collects all my favorite websites/blogs into one simple screen.  I don't care about actually visiting the website unless it has an article/blog post that I'm actually interested in commenting or reading comments on.  Right there is a time-saver.  I can get my daily reads done quickly and efficiently rather than surfing the web for something of interest.

I used to use Microsoft Outlook, Google's personal homepage, and even <a href="http://www.netvibes.com">NetVibes</a> to collect my feeds, but as I use several computers to read my news feeds, they would never sync what I already read.

#### Other Web Apps
A close second would be <a href="http://mail.google.com">Gmail</a>.  But lately the application has been getting features which I consider somewhat "bloating".  And I do mean this through the Labs feature.  There are just too many options that just add clutter and confusion to what's supposed to be a simple and fast interface for email.  Thankfully, I didn't enable many of them, but I do notice that Gmail seems to load slower than before.

I've also become more a bigger fan of microblogging through <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>.  I've armed myself with some software and services to help me 'tweet'.  I have the twitter client <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com">TweetDeck</a> installed on my PC and I'm using free services through <a href="http://twitterfeed.com">TwitterFeed</a> and <a href="http://twitpic.com">TwitPic</a>.  I definitely think there's some value behind real-time conversations through the sharing of interesting links.
