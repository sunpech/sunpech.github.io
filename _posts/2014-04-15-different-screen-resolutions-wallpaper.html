When I design websites and always wonder what the site would look like on different screen resolutions. I don't always have all the devices to test the layout on, so I generally will prefer to resize my browser window. I once had a wallpaper that had different screen resolutions marked out, but I couldn't find it or google it. So I decided to make my own.<br /><br />I joined <a href="http://www.pixelapse.com/">Pixelapse.com</a>&nbsp;and made a desktop wallpaper project. I found this site by <i>googling </i><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=git+psd+version+control&amp;oq=git+psd+version+control&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0j69i64.5534j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=git+photoshop+version+control"><i>'git photoshop version control'</i></a>. The project is in Photoshop.<br /><br />My screen is a 2560x1440 resolution 27" Mac display, so I made the wallpaper for that size. So it's ideal if your screen resolution matches that. Just resize your web browser to align with the markings and it should give you a good idea what the site looks like on that screen resolution.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy it, it's free for everybody!<br /><div><br /><a href="https://www.pixelapse.com/sunpech/projects/Screen%20Resolution%20Wallpaper/2560x1440_wallpaper.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-75gF8jF6mAU/U02pJ4uoXVI/AAAAAAABoHo/TQxJMKrEmFw/s1600/2560x1440_wallpaper.jpg" height="360" width="640" /></a><br /><div><br /></div><div>Project: <a href="http://www.pixelapse.com/s/C6WYTKJ3FH6R7QR3Q">Screen Resolution Wallpaper</a>&nbsp;(contains PSD file and JPG)<br /><div><br /></div><div><a href="https://www.pixelapse.com/sunpech/projects/Screen%20Resolution%20Wallpaper/2560x1440_wallpaper.jpg">Direct link to wallpaper</a><br /><br />Here are the resolutions marked:<br /><ul><li>1366x768 - 11" Macbook Airs</li><li>1440x900 - 13" Macbook Airs and older 15" Macbook Pros</li><li>1680x1050 - 15" Macbook Pros (my 2010 model)</li><li>1920x1080 - HD size</li><li>2560x1440 - 27" Mac display</li></ul><div><br /></div></div></div></div>
