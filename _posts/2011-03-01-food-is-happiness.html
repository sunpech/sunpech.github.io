I started a new blog/website over at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.foodishappiness.com/">foodishappiness.com</a>. I exported all my food posts from this site as well as from&nbsp;<a href="http://bestburgerintown.blogspot.com/">bestburgerintown.blogspot.com</a>&nbsp;(which I've abandoned)&nbsp;and imported them into the new site. It's just something new I wanted to try out, to see if I could generate content from my food/eating passion. I'm still on an "eating tour" of Bangkok, Thailand so to speak.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0hSDcQ2NkWc/TWySjHAavKI/AAAAAAAAhBg/s-7Ytz4ee5g/s1600/steven_icon.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0hSDcQ2NkWc/TWySjHAavKI/AAAAAAAAhBg/s-7Ytz4ee5g/s320/steven_icon.jpg" width="248" /></a></div><br />I know many say that <a href="http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;site=&amp;source=hp&amp;q=blogs+are+dead&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g1g-v2&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;psj=1&amp;bav=on.1,or.&amp;fp=a2885925ea8ae0">blogs are dead</a>. I certainly hope not. As much as I like&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, I just don't think 140 characters is enough to express many things.<br /><br />So read up on my food adventures, please turn to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.foodishappiness.com/">Food Is Happiness</a>&nbsp;site or follow&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/foodishappiness">@foodishappiness</a>&nbsp;on the Twitter. This site is still my personal blog, which will be less on food, more on photography, travel, and maybe some books. Happy eating!
