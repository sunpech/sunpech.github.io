I was out in Baltimore, Maryland for <a href="http://www.railsconf.com/">RailsConf</a> last week. The conference was great, but this was also the first time I've been in Baltimore other than for a flight layover. For the most part I was there for the 4 day conference and eating.

I must say that some of the neighborhoods in the evening/night didn't feel to safe to walk through. Also, the taxis there are so very expensive! I paid $22 (including tip) for a taxi to drive four miles. I'll be sure to have food pictures up on <a href="http://www.foodishappiness.com/">FoodIsHappiness.com</a> soon enough.

But this marks the end of my flying/adventuring for the time being. For the past month I've been on the plane 2-3 times per week, which has been tiring me out. I look forward to staying on the ground for a bit until I can make my way out to California.

Here are a few of my favorite pictures:

My busted bed when I arrived late Sunday night (no, I didn't break it...)

I thought this B&amp;N was super interesting.

Hybrid buses. Fast, Friendly, and Free
