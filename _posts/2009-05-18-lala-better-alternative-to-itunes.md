Several years ago, I tried out <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes">iTunes</a> and really enjoyed the experience. I came from a <a href="http://www.winamp.com">Winamp</a> background and really liked having a fast loading application. On top of that, I am a computer geek, so I already know where all my files are on the OS filesystem.

Anyway, after using iTunes for a little over a year and hundreds of songs purchased later, it was starting up slower and slower. Updates to Quicktime/iTunes was coming a little too often-- practically every time I started up the program, I had to download an update... which was quite annoying. Overall, the program was getting bloated on my Windows XP machine. So I uninstalled and switched back to using Winamp. It was fast and now also offered a music library for managing songs.

As good as Winamp is, it doesn't solve one problem I as a geek have. <i>I use multiple computers to get my work done.</i> One at work, several at my apartment, and even several at my parents house. I don't want to drag my music/files everywhere I go just to listen to it. (I'm a big enthusiast for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">Cloud Computing</a>).

So I came across <a href="http://20somethingfinance.com/blog/2009/05/10/give-up-itunes-in-favor-of-lala-save-money/">this post</a> on <a href="http://20somethingfinance.com">20somethingfinance.com</a> (one of my favorite financial blogs) on LaLa. I started using it and I'm loving it!

Here are the main highlights/advantages for using LaLa:

<ul>
 <li>You can play entire songs over the web, free</li>
 <li>It's a social network for music lovers, so you can get recommendations on similar music/artists</li>
 <li>Songs are cheap: 10 cents to add to your playlist, 89 cents to download a DRM free mp3</li>
</ul>

I have yet to try this, but supposedly if you already have a song on your computer, you can get it on your LaLa playlist for free.

Now, I'm not saying this is a complete replacement for iTunes/Winamp. If you are playing music on the go and disconnected from the Internet, you'll still need a music player application. This is just a awesome service for when you are connected. Give it a try, you get 50 free songs to add when you sign-up.
