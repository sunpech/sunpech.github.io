This blog post has two sections.<br /><br />For the past two days, I've been slowly reorganizing and curating my <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/sunpech/lists">Twitter lists</a>. After completing the task, I <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/sunpech/status/171670125043392512">sent out a tweet</a> as follows:<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-left" width="350"><i>Twitter needs a better UI for managing lists. The click and checkbox list is just horrible.</i><br /><i>â€” </i>Steven S. (@sunpech) <a data-datetime="2012-02-20T18:58:41+00:00" href="https://twitter.com/sunpech/status/171670125043392512">February 20, 2012</a></blockquote><script charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kpH_rN0Kttg/T0N5ScodgxI/AAAAAAAA6Y4/I0SUPPwQDKk/s1600/tweet_twitter_UI.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="137" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kpH_rN0Kttg/T0N5ScodgxI/AAAAAAAA6Y4/I0SUPPwQDKk/s400/tweet_twitter_UI.jpg" width="400" /></a><br /><br />What I was tweeting about how there is a dropbox-like feature that makes organizing (add/remove) twitter accounts to various lists very cumbersome. The screenshot below only shows the first step of several just to get the process started for EACH TWITTER ACCOUNT I want to edit. It's a real pain in the butt.<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-r2hdKWJeuH8/T0N6clZVCQI/AAAAAAAA6ZA/CmDPz0b97wk/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-02-21+at+3.04.11+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-r2hdKWJeuH8/T0N6clZVCQI/AAAAAAAA6ZA/CmDPz0b97wk/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-02-21+at+3.04.11+AM.png" /></a><br /><br />It almost makes me not want to keep lists even. It's certainly not a feature I use myself since I use <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/">Tweetdeck</a> and have a small-ish number of people I follow (less than 500)-- everyone is in a single scrolling column.<br /><br />End of section 1. <b>Point: Twitter List UI/UX* sucks.</b><br /><br />Onto section 2....<br /><br />Soon after my tweet, a twitter follower pointed me to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/holman">Zach Holman's</a>&nbsp;blog post,&nbsp;<a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/shit-work/">Don't Give Your Users Shit Work</a>. I agree with many of the points Zach points out, that social web software shouldn't make it a pain to maintain circles/lists/groups-- the shit work. The software needs to be smart in making default common groups, and being able to decide where friends/contacts go-- smart work.<br /><br />I disagree in the following situations:<br /><br /><ol><li>When there isn't enough good meta info of a contact to place in a proper lists.</li><li>When the list isn't for <b>private</b> use. It's for <b>public</b> use.</li></ol><div><div>The first point, when there isn't great meta info for the software, the list needs further <i>human</i> curation. The software may not be able to decide the best list to place the contact.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>For example, you've connected with someone on Facebook that's not connected to your network, school, work, or any group. You are close friends, but there are no <i>initial</i> indications that says otherwise. You would need to manually add them to your "Close Friends" group.</div><div><br /></div><div>The second point is the most important, when the lists being maintained isn't even for your personal use, but rather for public consumption. <i>The lists that I've generated I do not use whatsoever.</i> They're purely for others to view and follow if they feel that it would be of interest to them.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>For example:&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/sunpech/entities-chicago/members">Chicago entities</a>. I selected user-groups/meetups/entities in Chicago that I like and put them in a list. Twitter doesn't know that is the purpose of the list I just created. It's not a list I personally use since all my tweets are in a single column in Tweetdeck. The list is for someone who possibly thinks I know something or that I have good taste, and would like to follow what I think are good Chicago tweeple.</div><div><br /></div><div>My point is that it's not shit work nor smart work. It's just work that needs human thought and time to accomplish. Maybe my work is all for nothing, that no one finds it useful. I can live with that.</div><div><br /></div><div>* = UI is User Interface. UX is User Experience.</div>
