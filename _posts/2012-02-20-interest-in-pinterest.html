Last week I signed up for <a href="http://pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>. I've used it a bit, but haven't been that enthusiastic about it. I think it's interesting, but I definitely have some concerns if I could be a good user of their service.<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yCrv0Xj5bHs/T0MJRXQWWuI/AAAAAAAA6Ys/n4uOPCC2pqo/s1600/Pinterest_Logo.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="80" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yCrv0Xj5bHs/T0MJRXQWWuI/AAAAAAAA6Ys/n4uOPCC2pqo/s320/Pinterest_Logo.png" width="320" /></a><br /><br />For those of you unfamiliar with what I would call a new social-<i>thing</i>-sharing-service, from <a href="http://pinterest.com/about/help/">their website</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>Pinterest is a virtual pinboard. Pinterest allows you to organize and share all the beautiful things you find on the web. You can browse pinboards created by other people to discover new things and get inspiration from people who share your interests.</i><i><br /></i><i>People use pinboards to plan their weddings, decorate their homes, and share their favorite recipes.</i></blockquote>Just from their own description, they used the terms: <i>beautiful things, weddings, home&nbsp;decorations, </i>and&nbsp;<i>recipes</i>. None of this really applies to me! I mean, yes, I do like beautiful things, designs, art-- such as t-shirts, men's fashion, photography, artwork, and various tech gears, but I find myself wondering how much I would really want to share.<br /><br />Let me explain.<br /><br />I like what I like, it's my style or culture and whatnot. <b>I'm unsure if I would want others to try to copy my style</b>. I already don't like it for the rare&nbsp;occurrences&nbsp;when I meet anyone who has the exact same t-shirt I do.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love sharing knowledge such as interesting links, videos, articles, blogs, pictures, etc with my various social networks. But these aren't intimate in this real world such as personal fashion and style. Imagine if a friend decked out their living room to be so similar to yours because they saw some of the things you just pinned up. Or worse, they decked it out <i>better</i> than you did.<br /><br />I know this is unlikely to happen. Or is it? Already, maybe once a year I see someone wearing the exact same t-shirt I have. It's certainly not the end of the world, but it does make me glad that I didn't wear that exact t-shirt out that day.<br /><br />So I ask, what incentive do I have to share what I consider to be something of personal taste that can be copied widely by others in my social circles?<br /><br />Maybe I have it wrong. I love reading and sharing reviews on Amazon products I love. I also do reviews on&nbsp;<i>my very own blog</i>. That helps a person make a decision in buying the item if they come across it on Amazon or even my own site.&nbsp;But I suppose a slight advantage to doing that is because I'm an <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/">Amazon Affiliate</a>, where any clicks-thru purchases helps put money in my pocket.<br /><br />Maybe my real issue is that it's very much tied to what would be a very real social network. And because there is a specialized social network, it can be effectively used for specific interests. I wonder if my Amazon Affiliate link, when pinned to my board will be stripped my affiliate identification, and replaced with Pinterest's?<br /><br />Anyway, I'm not saying this service is horrible or anything. I actually think it's very good. But I'm just not feeling it after one week of using it.
