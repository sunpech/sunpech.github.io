After seeing the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/27/nexus-7-tablet-hands-on/">Nexus 7 tablet</a> make its debut at <a href="https://developers.google.com/events/io/">Google I/O</a>&nbsp;yesterday, it made me realize how my Kindle Fire (KF) is kind of lame. I <a href="http://www.sunpech.com/2011/11/kindle-fire-review.html">reviewed the Kindle Fire</a> back in November 2011.<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yU7gPhRWdPg/T-wtYgHP_BI/AAAAAAABOks/dvPzH189ZBg/s1600/Nexus7_tablets.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="220" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yU7gPhRWdPg/T-wtYgHP_BI/AAAAAAABOks/dvPzH189ZBg/s320/Nexus7_tablets.jpg" width="320" /></a><br /><br />To be fair though, my needs have changed. When I initially purchased the KF, I didn't want an iPad2 or a 10" tablet. I just wanted a simple reading device that could browse the web a bit and play some games. And that's exactly what the KF was, and <i>still</i> is.<br /><br />My needs have changed in that I want more. I want Gmail. I want YouTube. I want more apps.<br /><br />The problem is that over the past eight months, I haven't seen any big improvements happen from Amazon. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/appstore">Amazon App Store</a> has fewer of the apps I like available compared to <a href="https://play.google.com/store">Google Play</a>. On top of that, the Google Apps such as Gmail and YouTube aren't available. To me, the biggest reason to use Android is Google's products and services: Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube, etc. These are all solid apps that should be on any Android device.<br /><br />Besides the lack of Google Apps, there's no native Facebook app! The one in the Amazon App store simple redirects to a browser of the mobile site! This is incredibly misleading.<br /><br />On top of all of this, there are other nuances with the KF: The<span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;UI sucks. The carousel and bookshelf is just stupid. I'm sure there are folks that like how this UI is rather simple. It's just not for me.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;">I ended up installing Go Launcher EX alongside it. <i>(See <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/252821/get_more_out_of_your_kindle_fire_tablet_five_tips.html">instructions</a> on how to install it.)&nbsp;</i></span><span style="background-color: white;">The volume UI also is not readily available-- requires an extra click to get there. The rotating w</span><span style="background-color: white;">allpapers cannot be customized either.</span><br /><br />Recalling all these frustrations, I got pretty close to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_8gb&amp;feature=single-wide-banner">pre-ordering the Nexus 7</a>, which is priced exactly at $199, very competitively against the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />But I didn't.&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white;">Instead, I decided to just hack my Kindle Fire and see how close to a vanilla Android I could get.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">Below are instructions I followed to get a custom ROM (Simple CyanogenMod 9) onto my Kindle Fire by rooting it. </span><i style="background-color: white;">Disclaimer: I am not responsible for anything that goes wrong with your device if you attempt anything I have written and linked to below.</i><br /><br />The instructions are pretty clear and I highly recommend reading and following them.<br /><ol><li>Get Kindle Fire Utility (I used v0.9.6). See instructions <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1399889">here</a>.</li><li><span style="background-color: white;">Unzip the Kindle Fire Utility and install the drivers.</span></li><li><span style="background-color: white;">Root the device.</span></li><li><span style="background-color: white;">Install&nbsp;TWRP Recovery.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;">For instructions, see:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-root-and-install-custom-recovery-on-kindle-fire-using-the-kindle-fire-utility-53451/" style="background-color: white;">How to Root and Install Custom Recovery on Kindle Fire using Kindle Fire Utility</a><span style="background-color: white;">.</span></li><li>Install <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1689000">Simple CyanogenMod 9 ROM (6-10-2012)</a>. For instructions, see:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/kindle-fire-install-simple-cyanogenmod-9-cm9-custom-rom-94468/">Amazon Kindle Fire: Flashing the Simple CM9 custom ROM</a>.</li></ol><i>Note, for the developers out there that have the Android SDK installed, the KF Utility has adb packaged in it already.</i><br /><br />So, I was able to put Simple CM9 on my Kindle Fire using the instructions in the links listed above. Here's a picture my KF running Google Play that's downloading Google Chrome browser.<br /><img border="0" height="255" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hr8zlreqFxA/T-wdvcKwkLI/AAAAAAABOkU/AzA_v4aHOpQ/s320/KindleFire_install.jpg" style="color: #0000ee;" width="320" /><br /><br />Here is a screenshot of my homescreen after some customizations.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9JkOUEYz448/T-wdudcS1AI/AAAAAAABOkM/9bI-Duke840/s1600/KindleFIre_screenshot.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9JkOUEYz448/T-wdudcS1AI/AAAAAAABOkM/9bI-Duke840/s320/KindleFIre_screenshot.jpg" width="187" /></a><br /><br />Another screenshot of the Settings and tablet information.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4CwSoFCK5UA/T-wocAEdv_I/AAAAAAABOkg/D4rvCf0SAX0/s1600/KindleFire_screenshot_02.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4CwSoFCK5UA/T-wocAEdv_I/AAAAAAABOkg/D4rvCf0SAX0/s320/KindleFire_screenshot_02.jpg" width="187" /></a> <br /><br />Overall, it was a pretty simple process. Just follow the instructions. I was able to re-download my Kindle books again using Kindle app in the Google Play store. My Kindle Fire is just awesome now. Maybe I'm speaking too soon, as it hasn't even been a full twenty-four hours of running it just yet. I do notice that it sucks up the battery a lot more, but that should be obvious as I'm running a heavier UI and more apps.<br /><br />These are exciting times aren't they? Microsoft has entered the tablet space (once again) with their <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en/us/default.aspx">Surface</a>. Or at least the announcement of it. There's <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/26/3119096/amazon-kindle-fire-successor-july-31-release-rumor">rumor</a> of a new Kindle Fire from Amazon next month. A lot of competition, which in the end the consumers win.<br /><br /><b>**Update (January 8, 2013)**</b><br />Just wanted to add that there is a way to root the Kindle Fire from a Mac. Just use <a href="http://northmendo.com/breakdroid/downloads/">BreakDroid</a>. The Kindle Fire Utility doesn't work on my Windows 8 Pro virtual machine like it did on Windows 7 Ultimate.<br /><br />Also, I switched to use <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1766829">Jandycane</a>&nbsp;instead of CM. Still basically the same steps as above, but it gives me Jelly Bean on the tablet. I don't expect any more updates for custom ROMs on KF simply because Google Nexus tablets are superior in every way.<br /><br /><b>**Update (August 7, 2013)**</b><br />A few weeks ago I switched back to using <a href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Otter_Info">Cyanogenmod on the Kindle Fire</a>&nbsp;(1st Generation). Overall it's been pretty good, but my KF is now my secondary tablet device since I got a <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/7/">Nexus 7</a> (2nd Gen).<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EhMga98kv8g/UgIfPMwrWSI/AAAAAAABhZs/WBJ6dUCSoOc/s1600/cyanogenmod_KF.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EhMga98kv8g/UgIfPMwrWSI/AAAAAAABhZs/WBJ6dUCSoOc/s320/cyanogenmod_KF.jpg" width="187" /></a><br /><br />
