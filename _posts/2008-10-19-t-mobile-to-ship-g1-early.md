As my friend Ben pointed out, it's possible that our pre-ordered G1 phones will arrive earlier than expected.  Tomorrow, Monday, October 20, 2008 to be exact.  Upon checking my order status on <a href="http://www.ups.com">UPS.com</a>, I found the following:

So it looks like my Google phone is here in Chicago, and is set to ship tomorrow!
