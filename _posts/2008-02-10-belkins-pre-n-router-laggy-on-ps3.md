I've spent the better part of this cold weekend indoors trying to configure my PS3 to work on the Playstation Network.  My problem was that I would get lag when playing Puzzle Fighter 3 Turbo HD Remix.  I've been using the <b>Belkin Pre-N Router</b> for the past few months for everything but gaming and have been content with it.  But frankly, it doesn't play well with my PS3!  I went to <a href="http://www.portforward.com/">portforward.com</a> and forwarded all the ports to my PS3, and I still got lag!  The only time I wouldn't get that much lag would be to hook the system straight to my cable modem.  I tried everything from giving a static IP address, wireless setup, to even a wired connection to the router, all of which did nothing to remove the lag.

I switched my router back to the <b>Linksys WRT54GX4 SRX 400</b>, forwarded all the ports, and it worked!  So the problem then was truly the Belkin router.  As much as I liked Belkin's hardware and performance, I never really liked it's GUI on the router setup page.  I only retired this Linksys router because for a period of time it would drop wireless connections every few minutes.  I always thought it was because in my area there would be blackouts/surges all the time, which seems to fry the wireless portion of my routers.  But it seems to be holding up fine now.  Go figure.  I've always liked Linksys routers/switches (I've gone through about 3-4 of them over the years), but they just don't seem to last long.  Let's hope this one holds up.
