On March 5, 2011, my friend and I got tickets to the Asahi Fireworks show. Obviously the fireworks show is at night, so during the day I took my camera out to play and test it out since I hadn't taken too many pictures with it lately.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that there was a photo shoot and interviews of girls going on at Siam Paragon. I happened to be at the right place at the right time.&nbsp;Some pictures of pretty girls:<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LcPLDQ5nwTI/TXIGEL0zuQI/AAAAAAAAhXs/W0WeMtpNwuQ/s1600/IMG_4853.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LcPLDQ5nwTI/TXIGEL0zuQI/AAAAAAAAhXs/W0WeMtpNwuQ/s320/IMG_4853.jpg" width="320" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3_n6O3z4aQg/TXIGLhSkDTI/AAAAAAAAhYE/Y2Ds-hWRNKk/s1600/IMG_4855.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3_n6O3z4aQg/TXIGLhSkDTI/AAAAAAAAhYE/Y2Ds-hWRNKk/s320/IMG_4855.jpg" width="320" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Z4hEvbonfbg/TXIGVgjjSFI/AAAAAAAAhYU/d6PXNz0axl4/s1600/IMG_4857.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Z4hEvbonfbg/TXIGVgjjSFI/AAAAAAAAhYU/d6PXNz0axl4/s320/IMG_4857.jpg" width="320" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BcOfAo_f2WU/TXIGhh8abEI/AAAAAAAAhY0/--VvEmeIyns/s1600/IMG_4864.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BcOfAo_f2WU/TXIGhh8abEI/AAAAAAAAhY0/--VvEmeIyns/s320/IMG_4864.jpg" width="320" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OOOyjlLLwDw/TXIICFwpNvI/AAAAAAAAhck/k1VZYK614Jc/s1600/IMG_4894.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OOOyjlLLwDw/TXIICFwpNvI/AAAAAAAAhck/k1VZYK614Jc/s320/IMG_4894.jpg" width="320" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BiYF8puzGNA/TXIIFxZcUtI/AAAAAAAAhc0/_bU9K9er2F8/s1600/IMG_4896.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BiYF8puzGNA/TXIIFxZcUtI/AAAAAAAAhc0/_bU9K9er2F8/s320/IMG_4896.jpg" width="320" /></a><br /><br />Full album of photoshoot&nbsp;<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/101693597219413173200/2011March5GirlsPhotoshoot">here</a>.<br /><br />This was the first time I used my camera (Canon Rebel XT) to take pictures of fireworks. I was in bulb mode for the most part. The part that annoyed me was that the security there didn't allow me to set up my tripod in the VVIP (very very important person) section. How is that VVIP then? I kept moving to different areas and they kept saying that I wasn't allowed to set up my tripod. So I pretty much relied on my arms in bulb mode....<br /><br />Anyway, after they let in people in from the outside, and more than half way through the show, I set up my tripod. At this point I was seated in an ocean of people, not like they could get to anyone who set up a tripod. I ended up switching to manual mode from bulb mode because I was just getting too much smoke in my pictures.<br /><br />I think the problem was that I was seated not too far from a building/bridge that was well lit, so a lot of light was hitting the smoke already. There was a photographer's area, but it was far far away and as I heard it, very crowded. But it was definitely a better area to take photos of fireworks as they were far from the building.<br /><br />Here are some photos of my first try taking pictures of fireworks:<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BBGVRNqfCZs/TXKDOcg9diI/AAAAAAAAhe8/2aUcGVJ5DMg/s1600/IMG_4903.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BBGVRNqfCZs/TXKDOcg9diI/AAAAAAAAhe8/2aUcGVJ5DMg/s320/IMG_4903.jpg" width="320" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x_YFI8qoLYI/TXKDY_R-mRI/AAAAAAAAhfU/60J9HrHxNNk/s1600/IMG_4911.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x_YFI8qoLYI/TXKDY_R-mRI/AAAAAAAAhfU/60J9HrHxNNk/s320/IMG_4911.jpg" width="320" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aEN_r2NeKz8/TXKEZre8bGI/AAAAAAAAhic/NYpyKI0qz8E/s1600/IMG_4963.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aEN_r2NeKz8/TXKEZre8bGI/AAAAAAAAhic/NYpyKI0qz8E/s320/IMG_4963.jpg" width="320" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jC6AEi5Nd0U/TXKEtlX7vlI/AAAAAAAAhjQ/51F6cCTcz2I/s1600/IMG_4971.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jC6AEi5Nd0U/TXKEtlX7vlI/AAAAAAAAhjQ/51F6cCTcz2I/s320/IMG_4971.jpg" width="320" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UkEqeX99Cuw/TXKFbbHL2BI/AAAAAAAAhlI/vwUSXEl4N68/s1600/IMG_4987.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UkEqeX99Cuw/TXKFbbHL2BI/AAAAAAAAhlI/vwUSXEl4N68/s320/IMG_4987.jpg" width="320" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QIhin43BjFU/TXKH7kXEyzI/AAAAAAAAhsM/EGLcloTpKd8/s1600/IMG_5054.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QIhin43BjFU/TXKH7kXEyzI/AAAAAAAAhsM/EGLcloTpKd8/s320/IMG_5054.jpg" width="320" /></a><br /><br />Full album of fireworks <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/101693597219413173200/2011March5AsahiFireworksShow">here</a>.
