Just got back from watching a special advanced screening of <a href="http://www.sushimovie.com/">Jiro Dreams of Sushi</a> at the Landmark. Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/tisaisha">Aisha</a> and <a href="http://www.foodspotting.com/">Foodspotting</a> for putting me on the list!

The documentary is wonderful! Besides the very appealing video of sushi on the big screen, there is quite a story of Jiro Ono and his sushi restaurant, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukiyabashi_Jiro">Sukiyabashi Jiro</a>. There certainly is craftsmanship and art to making sushi-- which Jiro has dedicated his life to.

What was really nice about this showing was that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0312173/">David Gelb</a> was there! He stayed after the screening to answer questions. He shared that he started filming with a DSLR, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TG3ZYQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002TG3ZYQ">Canon 1D Mark IV</a>, before bumping it up to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Digital_Cinema_Camera_Company">Red One</a>.

When asked what his favorite sushi restaurant is in LA, he said it was <a href="http://www.sushinozawa.com/">Sushi Nozawa</a>, which as it turns out will be <a href="http://eater.com/archives/2012/01/26/las-sushi-nozawa-to-close.php">closing down on February 29</a>.

The movie will be out in the US on <b>March 9, 2012</b>. I recommend everyone check it out!
