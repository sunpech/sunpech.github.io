Across the street from me, in Chicago's River West, the construction of <a href="http://www.jewelosco.com">Jewel Osco</a> is complete.  The grand opening is tomorrow: Friday September 26, 2008.  I'm pretty excited about this.  When I lived in Boston, I had a Starmarket (now a <a href="http://www.shaws.com">Shaws</a>) a few blocks from me, and it literally served as my big refrigerator.<br /><br /><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SNvoD_XqqjI/AAAAAAAAIGQ/ZRvoXbnuHV8/s400/IMG00044.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5250044945878395442" /><br /><br />Now I'll have the same here in Chicago.  I'll have access to fresh meat, fruits, and vegetables whenever.  I probably won't need to stock up on much of anything in my actual fridge.  This also probably means the end of my need to use <a href="http://www.peapod.com">PeaPod</a>.<br /><br />It's location is right at Desplaines and Kinzie.  Also, across the parking lot from Jewel is a <a href="http://www.chase.com">Chase</a> bank.  Sweet.<br /><br />[UPDATE 9/27/2008] - The street lights have flag banners with West Loop on it, so maybe my area is considered more West Loop than River West.  Just a thought.
