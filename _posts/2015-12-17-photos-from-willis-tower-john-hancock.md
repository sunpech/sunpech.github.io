A few days ago my niece visited Chicago for the first time and I took her around to see and eat some of the best my city has to offer. Although I've [visited John Hancock Observatory before](/2014/01/photos-from-chicagos-john-hancock/), I haven't been up to [Willis Tower](http://www.willistower.com/) (specifically the [Skydeck](http://theskydeck.com/)) since it was called the [Sears Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Tower).

The challenge with taking photos at these locations was that we went up right after it rained and there were a lot of cloud/fog surrounding Chicago. Not to mention the windows at Willis Tower are incredibly dirty!

Here are some basic tips to improve your photos:

1. Bring your camera right up to the windows to reduce light reflections.
2. Use your coat to help block out rear reflections. It really helps to have a friend hold up your coat behind you or your camera. You can also use the railings.
3. Get low and steady. Although you can't bring a tripod, you can bring a [gorillapod](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVSLRO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000EVSLRO&linkCode=as2&tag=sunpech-20&linkId=SLSLHX3O4YJM5TAI).

All my editing was done purely in [Adobe Lightroom](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VWCKJVA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00VWCKJVA&linkCode=as2&tag=sunpech-20&linkId=CDTELKXYIG2RF3IK).
