Microsoft has a new logo design for their operating system (OS), Windows. I've been reading a few tech bloggers/writers reactions to it lately, and I felt I just had to add my two bits in.<br /><br />The last time I did a blog post on logo design, was on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sunpech.com/2009/02/tropicanas-new-logo-design.html">Tropicana's new logo design</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://parislemon.com/">MG Siegler's</a> recent blog post on <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/17779606945/the-microsoft-windows-logo-evolves-from-microsoft">Microsoft's new logo evolution</a>&nbsp;was the first ones I read.&nbsp;<a href="http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2012/02/a-flag-no-more-microsoft-unveils-new-windows-logo.ars">Other writers</a>&nbsp;have also written how the new logo is&nbsp;no longer wavy and flag-like. Here is an excerpt of from Siegler's post:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>Itâ€™s true that the Windows logo has long looked like a waving flag, which makes absolutely no sense.</i></blockquote>What?!<br /><br />I have no qualms with anyone calling the Windows logo a flag. It is like a flag. A waving flag.<br /><br />I take issue with the criticism of it not making sense. Since when do logos need to look like the name of the product?<br /><br />Let's look at the history of Microsoft Windows logos:<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BmC11EGm9FY/Tz_zb7mpX0I/AAAAAAAA6QY/vTKHaLa55XE/s1600/windows_old.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BmC11EGm9FY/Tz_zb7mpX0I/AAAAAAAA6QY/vTKHaLa55XE/s1600/windows_old.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RQRDsmjqUNc/Tz_zb6VrpkI/AAAAAAAA6QU/yug8I6K-uJ4/s1600/windows_31.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RQRDsmjqUNc/Tz_zb6VrpkI/AAAAAAAA6QU/yug8I6K-uJ4/s1600/windows_31.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ppHBW5cqFQA/Tz_zcA9F7_I/AAAAAAAA6Qk/nrnOmZ_JGgM/s1600/windows_xp.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ppHBW5cqFQA/Tz_zcA9F7_I/AAAAAAAA6Qk/nrnOmZ_JGgM/s1600/windows_xp.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ACVSs04OjjA/Tz_zcA-VwOI/AAAAAAAA6Q0/cKsZz7W6JQU/s1600/windows_vista.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ACVSs04OjjA/Tz_zcA-VwOI/AAAAAAAA6Q0/cKsZz7W6JQU/s1600/windows_vista.jpg" /></a><br /><br />Here is the new Windows 8 logo:<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-42iEID-IPqw/Tz_6Be0YvfI/AAAAAAAA6RM/4OQuMe4ATqE/s1600/windows_8_logo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-42iEID-IPqw/Tz_6Be0YvfI/AAAAAAAA6RM/4OQuMe4ATqE/s1600/windows_8_logo.jpg" /></a><br />I think the new logo is better and more simple, and has influence from Windows Metro design. Yes, it definitely resembles a window. But where else can we see this kind of logo design? Any other product, maybe from Microsoft that has four boxes with colors?<br /><br />Microsoft Office.<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XV1M-I3ffwM/Tz__XGXbPGI/AAAAAAAA6RU/N8QoCHH_fNQ/s1600/office_logo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XV1M-I3ffwM/Tz__XGXbPGI/AAAAAAAA6RU/N8QoCHH_fNQ/s1600/office_logo.jpg" /></a><br /><br />Does the Office logo resemble an office? Not really... but <i>I guess with a stretch of the imagination it could look like office cubicles</i>.<br /><br />The point being, Microsoft's line of product logos are similar. They are inter-related. Office and Windows are the brands and flagship products from Microsoft. That's right, I used the word <i>flag</i>. The four boxes are iconic of the original windows in their OS. I see no reason why they would need to change this.<br /><br />If anyone has a problem with Microsoft's product naming conventions, then maybe they need to do something how&nbsp;<a href="http://digitallife.today.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/02/03/10309985-how-the-internet-helped-a-child-turn-tiger-bread-into-giraffe-bread">Lily Robinson wrote to Sainsbury's</a>, which resulted in them&nbsp;changing Tiger bread to Giraffe bread.
