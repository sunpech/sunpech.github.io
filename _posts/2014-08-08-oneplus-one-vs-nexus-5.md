Last month in July, I purchased two Android phones: <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/5/">The Nexus 5</a> (N5) and the <a href="http://www.oneplus.net/">OnePlus One</a> (OPO). I initially ordered the Nexus 5 because I was sick of waiting for an OnePlus invite that I signed up for in April. Up until then, I was using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Nexus">Galaxy Nexus</a> for two years and its overall performance was rather sluggish and could no longer hold a charge for half a day.

I got the white Nexus 5 (16GB). I had it only for a few weeks before I got a OnePlus invite in mid-July. I had to act quickly since the invite was good for only 24 hours. I was already happy with the Nexus 5, but here I was given an opportunity to try out something highly sought after. So after some talking I was able to find a new home for my Nexus 5 and decided to move forward to be one of the lucky few OPO owners.

## Nexus 5

<b>I consider the Nexus 5 to be the best Nexus device that Google has made to date</b>. I've used the G1, Nexus One, Nexus S, Galaxy Nexus, and the current one-- basically all the Nexus devices except for the Nexus 4.

Prior to the N5, I've always felt that the Nexus One was the best Nexus device for its time. I even wrote about <a href="/2010/01/my-new-phone-googles-nexus-one">my unboxing of the Nexus One</a> back in 2010. The device <i>still</i> works well running an old Cyanogen ROM on it.

<b>What I love about the N5 is that it's light, fast, and has a great battery life</b>. I can get through a day easily with it. My carrier is T-Mobile and the reception is amazing on it-- I have 4G/LTE everywhere I went in Los Angeles. It's also a cheap device: $400.

At first I thought that the phone would be too big and uncomfortable to use. After using it for only a few weeks, I found that this wasn't the case at all. The Nexus 5 fits really well in hand and because it's so light, it's easy to maneuver around with one hand.

I cannot think of a single thing to dislike about this phone. None.

## OnePlus One

The OPO is running <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/">Cyanogenmod</a> 11s and it runs it rather well. A concern I had about ordering this device is that it is even bigger than the Nexus 5!

What I love about it is that it boots and feels faster than the Nexus 5. The screen is nice and big and the CM build is rather nice. It's a cheap, 64GB black model ($350)-- which has incredible value. A device of this build would normally sell for twice the cost! The battery life is also even better than the Nexus 5-- I can get through almost 2 days of regular use!

It comes with it's own special USB charger, which gives it a nice flair. The 64GB model comes with the black backing, which a lot of people like how it looks and feels. I can't agree with that, as I prefer my mobile devices to look more sleek than sandpaper.

The CM Theme chooser is nice, but for the most part it's not something I really care for. I actually prefer the standard icons from vanilla Android as opposed to any of the custom themes, wallpapers, icons, etc. I also don't care for the Trebuchet launcher that comes with CM. But again, I prefer <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.launcher&amp;hl=en">Google Now launcher</a>, which is available for devices running Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) and higher.

I also don't care for the camera much. Since I use my DSLR for my camera needs, I rarely use my Android devices to take pictures. As to the quality of the pictures produced, I don't really care for them as I tend to post process pictures I care about anyway.

What I don't like is that it's a heavier device than the Nexus 5. I can really notice it. The buttons aren't as nice as the Nexus 5. All the buttons don't feel as nice nor do I like the placement of the power button. It just feels a bit off in that I have to feel for where the buttons are. I also end up using the capacitive (software) screen buttons instead, and disabling the phone actual navigation buttons. <b>The phone's navigation buttons are located too low on the phone</b>, so it makes it hard to reach them without fumbling the phone out of your hand-- the balance is not there. Plus it's limited to just back, home, and menu-- which isn't quite the standard anymore.

<b>The CM 11S build is also a bit buggy</b>. I get app crashes consistently on certain workflows. I do hope that they get fixed in the next update. Even the Android L Preview is more stable than this ROM.

## Final Thoughts

<b>Between the Nexus 5 and the OPO, I actually prefer the Nexus 5.</b> This is because my needs for disk space isn't very high. 64GB is more than I really need for my on the go device. I don't store my music collection or movies on my phone. The Nexus 5 has <i>zero drawbacks,</i> while the OPO is a bit uncomfortable to use with the build and bugs I experience.

I will of course be keeping my OPO device. I am considering flashing the <a href="https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/rom-official-4-4-4-oneplus-aosp.65482/">Android 4.4.4 stock ROM (official)</a> onto it. It's really awesome that it's even available already. But I think I'll stick it out until the next CM update.
