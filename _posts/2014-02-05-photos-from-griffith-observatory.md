I use <a href="http://500px.com/">500px</a> to do research on where I want to go take pictures and what kind of shots to do. <a href="http://500px.com/photo/44626440">One in particular </a>compelled me to go to Griffith Park to get a shot of the <a href="http://www.griffithobs.org/">Griffith Observatory</a> as well as LA's skyline.

I went on a different day and night to get a night shot of the Observatory as well as LA's skyline (see below). This is my favorite shot, as I consider LA to be more of a city lights kind of city. Any daylight photos would be better served on the beaches of LA.

### On Getting Lost

I got lost twice trying to get to this location.

The first time my GPS took me near a pinned location of where I thought the shot I wanted was taken, but I just didn't see the view at all. So I went to the Observatory for some simple sunrise shots.

The second time, after more research, I took a bike trail, which is an actual road closed off to cars. I went at 6am and thought it would be easy to find. It wasn't. I ended up overshooting and hiked nearly four times the distance. Anyway, it turned out that it's not really the spot I wanted. You can see how far in <span style="color: #93c47d;">green</span> below.

The third time was the charm. I went even earlier, at 5:40am. Took the Mt. Hollywood Trail path and found the spot very easily. Unfortunately they were filming Glee at the Griffith Observatory that day and there was a lot of trailers and lights setup in the parking lot. So there was definitely more lights and cars there than I wanted. Only about fifteen parking spots were available to the general public, while the rest of the lot was reserved.

Below is the map of the area and the paths I took:

<span style="color: #ea9999;">Pink</span>, is the original, planned path I wanted to go on.
<span style="color: #b6d7a8;">Green</span>, is the actual path I went on today. Looks more like I went almost 4 times the distance!
<span style="color: #6fa8dc;">Blue</span>, is the last path I went on that actually took me to the spot I wanted.

Here is another shot of Griffith Observatory with all the trailers and sets from the Glee crew:

Some observations I've made about going to Griffith Park:
<ol>
  <li>It can be a bit scary hiking in the morning when there's no sunlight. I did end up purchasing a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MFK7H2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002MFK7H2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sunpech-20">Energizer Pro 7 LED Headlamp</a>.</li>
  <li>No matter how early you get to Griffith Park, someone will be there hiking even earlier.</li>
  <li>Many Koreans and elderly folks are there walking in groups or even as couples.</li>
  <li>There are tons of hiking/biking trails in Griffith Park. I definitely want to go back there with friends.</li>
  <li>At night, there aren't as many hikers as in the morning.</li>
</ol>
