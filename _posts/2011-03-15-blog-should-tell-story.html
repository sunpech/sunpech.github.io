After going through some very old blog posts (I've been blogging since 1999), I was reminded of why I started blogging back then. Simply put: <i>I liked to share my thoughts and interests with an audience</i>. Of course back then it was simply with family, friends, and random people who stumbled upon my blog. This was a time <i>before</i> <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, and even <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>. Back then it was mostly just <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> that was my biggest influence as to how I shared myself. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsianAve">Asian Avenue</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL">AOL</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocities">Geocities</a> were all dying out, at least amongst my friends.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Back then I believe I had a better audience interaction because of the following two reasons:</div><div><ol><li>No one else really was blogging, so my blog was what my friends and family read because it was the <i>kind of Facebook</i> of the time.</li><li>I was telling a story, of me.</li></ol><div>The second reason is what I would like to talk about briefly. I want to get back into being a better blogger. To do that, <i>I need to do a better job of telling a story about me</i>. I want readers of my posts to be able to connect with me as a real person. As much as I enjoy facebook-statusing and tweeting, it never seems to be enough to get a picture of who the tweeter is. I like how it's short/concise and in real-time, but 140 characters is barely enough to form a paragraph in English. The most common is simply a link to something more interesting to read in full.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Maybe I'm just&nbsp;<i>old school</i>.</div><div><br /></div><div>I've set up the following sites to help me become a better blogger:</div><div><ul><li>This site - My personal blog about me, my adventures, photography, books, and all-around anything that isn't about technology and food.</li><li><a href="http://www.foodishappiness.com/">FoodIsHappiness.com</a>&nbsp;- My website/blog about my food adventures.</li><li><a href="http://www.spong.org/">Spong.org</a>&nbsp;- My blog on technology, software, and various tech user groups I meet with.</li></ul>These 3 sites pretty much sum up all that I like to share about myself.&nbsp;This is how I will tell the story of me. Pick whatever news/twitter feed you wish to consume information on me at.&nbsp;And of course in real time, you can follow me at&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/sunpech">@sunpech</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/foodishappiness">@foodishappiness</a>.</div>
