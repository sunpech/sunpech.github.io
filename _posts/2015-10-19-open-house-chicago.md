On Sunday I went to checkout [Open House Chicago](http://openhousechicago.org) and did a little photowalk of my own. I actually had no plan to go until my sister gave me her priority pass the morning of. But I'm glad I did as it was not only had some good photops, but was a nice steps in too since I use [FitBit](https://www.fitbit.com/).

The places I visited:

* [The Oriental Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_Theatre_%28Chicago%29)
* [Joffrey Ballet](http://www.joffrey.org/)
* [Aon Center](http://www.aoncenter.info/toc.cfm)
* [Continental Illinois Bank Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Illinois)
* [The Rookery](http://therookerybuilding.com/)

My favorite spot was the Aon Center. I went up to the 71st floor and had a 360 degree view of Chicago from the third tallest building in the city.

### Other Shots

Like [before](/2015/09/adams-wabash-cta-station/), I processed them to be black and white. You can see more photos in my [Facebook Chicago album](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.951834838214874.1073741896.408588035872893&type=3).
