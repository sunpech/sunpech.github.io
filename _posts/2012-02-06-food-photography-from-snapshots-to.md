As a foodie and photography enthusiast, I found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321784111/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321784111">Food Photography: From Snapshots to Great Shots</a> to be a good read, mostly. Although, I did find myself skimming the later chapters as they deal with post-processing using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003B32B2I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003B32B2I">Adobe Photoshop</a>.

The first three chapters on fundamentals, equipment, and lighting I thought were the best for foodies interested in improving their skills as a photographer. The chapter on framing and composition is good too. These chapters I think are the best chapters to read for foodies looking to improve their skill on taking pictures of food.

The rest of the book talks about styling/props and the post-processing, which may be a bit much for those not interested in doing studio-like setups. To be honest, when I take pictures of food, I don't cook it myself, I don't have a setup in place, and most importantly-- I plan on eating the food I take a picture of!
