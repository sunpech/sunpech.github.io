A few years ago I envisioned a world where computers would return back to acting more like terminal PCs connected to a mainframe.  A world where accessing files/applications locally would be a thing of the past.  In a way, that's what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">Cloud Computing</a> seems to be about.  A user can be on any computer (albeit a PC, a Mac, or a Linux box), all that is required is Internet connection and a web browser, and the user can run most of his/her computing needs.<br /><br /><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5233868836528939586" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SKJv-gJLYkI/AAAAAAAAAlQ/VNgf9rCJw1I/s400/datacenter.gif" /><br /><br />I think it's interesting that applications these days are almost synonymous with web applications than with the original desktop application.  I wanted to share some of my favorite online applications with everyone, and encourage you to also tap into the cloud.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Email and RSS feeds</span><br />I'm relying less on using <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/outlook/">Microsoft Outlook</a> and/or <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a> to collect my email and RSS feeds.  I utilize both <a href="https://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a> and <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a> for all that now.  I can read/add/search for anything on either my home PC, laptop, or work PC.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />Bookmarking</span><br />One of the main reasons I wrote my own blog application back in 1999/2000 was because I wanted a way to bookmark interesting websites.  I hated that I could bookmark a website on one computer, but I wouldn't be able to get at it from another PC.  A classmate originally wrote it in Perl, but I translated it to PHP.  Here is the <a href="http://cs-people.bu.edu/spong/articles/">link</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://delicious.com/">Delicious</a> does a fantastic job of this.  Good job <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> on acquiring them in 2005!  As far as I know, this was the first site that I started to <span style="font-style: italic;">tag </span>with.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />Pictures, Videos, and Instant Messaging</span><br /><a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a> is my favorite site to store all my picture albums.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> isn't so much a greta place to store videos, as it is to share them.  But more or less becoming the same thing.  <a href="http://www.meebo.com/">Meebo</a> is pretty nice in how it collects all the IM services in one place.  Although, honestly, I'm still a big user of the <a href="http://www.digsby.com/">Digsby</a> desktop application.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Office Suite</span><br />I can't say I write my word docs or excel spreadsheets online yet.  I know there's <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a>, but I haven't really caught onto that just yet.  I'm just really more of a <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>.
