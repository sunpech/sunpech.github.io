I finally finished reading&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Coders-at-Work-Peter-Seibel/dp/1430219483?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=spongtech-20&amp;link_code=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969" target="_blank">Coders at Work</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=spongtech-20&amp;l=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969&amp;o=1&amp;a=1430219483" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;" width="1" />! &nbsp;I really enjoyed the interviews with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski">Jamie Zawinksi</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford">Douglas Crockford</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich">Brendan Eich</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>. &nbsp;I wasn't too interested in compilers and the much older systems some of the programmers once developed in. &nbsp;I must admit, I had a short attention span reading over those sections.<br /><br />Anyway, the reason I picked this book up was because back in late September to early October 2009, I remember reading several blog posts on <i>duct tape programming</i>. &nbsp;They all pointed to&nbsp;Joel Spolsky's blog post:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html">The Duct Tape Programmer</a>.<br /><br />The quote was from Jamie Zawinkski, on his pet peeve of developers who over-engineer:<br /><blockquote>At the end of the day, ship the fucking thing! &nbsp;It's great to rewrite code and make it cleaner and by the third time it'll actually be pretty. &nbsp;But that's not the point-- you're not here to write code; you're here to ship products. &nbsp;--Jamie Zawinkski<br /></blockquote>My first reaction after reading Spolsky's post was with some disgust. &nbsp;The word that came to mind was: <i>Grief</i>. &nbsp;Software developer grief. &nbsp;Let me explain.<br /><br />I define software developer grief as the unhappiness a developer gets from inheriting badly written or non-functional code from another developer. &nbsp;I have felt this grief a few times. &nbsp;I've had to work with code where it's been released out to production, where the code doesn't even function properly and hasn't, EVER.<br /><br />Now I'm not aware of what the development conditions were like when those kind of coding projects were in place. &nbsp;But, the code, definitely shouldn't have shipped. &nbsp;In these cases, duct-tape or band-aids were used instead of a functioning wheel to the go-cart; because the go-cart just wasn't doing what it should have been doing.<br /><br />But after reading&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/09/24/the-duct-tape-programmer">Uncle Bob's response</a>, it made more sense what Spolsky was talking about. &nbsp;The spirit of what they're both preaching, is to ship working code, it doesn't have to be pretty or perfect, just make it work! &nbsp;The clean-up can, and should occur later. <br /><br />That, I agree with.<br /><br />Get the book on Amazon:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Coders-at-Work-Peter-Seibel/dp/1430219483?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=spongtech-20&amp;link_code=bil&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img alt="Coders at Work" src="http://ws.amazon.com/widgets/q?MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ASIN=1430219483&amp;tag=spongtech-20" /></a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=spongtech-20&amp;l=bil&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969&amp;o=1&amp;a=1430219483" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;" width="1" />
