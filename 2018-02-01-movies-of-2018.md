This looks like a good year for not just comic book fans, but fans of books and other franchises because there are so many sequels coming out. This is why I dropped doing comic book only movies for my posts and opened it up to all movies.

Here are my top 8 movies that I think will be hits:

1. Avengers: Infinity War
2. Black Panther
3. Ready Player One
4. Incredibles 2
5. Ant-Man and The Wasp
6. Deadpool 2
7. Alita: Battle Angel
8. Venom

## Quick Thoughts

[Black Panther](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1825683/) - February 16, 2018. The trailers for this movie looks amazing. The MCU gets a little bit bigger with this newest addition.

[Ready Player One](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1677720/) - March 29, 2018. I read the [book](http://amzn.to/2DTgtTj) a while ago. The auther, Ernest Cline, really likes the 1980s. And with [Steven Spielberg](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt7133092/) behind the movie, the movie can't get much bigger. The movie may potentially be better than the book!

[Avengers: Infinity War](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/) - May 4, 2018. The culmination of all things, of 10 years of Marvel Cinematic Universe. The world will finally see how much of a badass Thanos is in the Marvel universe! This is easily the movie I look forward to watching the most. The [Russo brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo_brothers) have done an amazing job with Captain America movies, I expect even better with this movie.

[Deadpool 2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5463162/) - May 18, 2018 (originally June 1, 2018). I'm a little indifferent about this movie. The first DP movie was fantastic, but we'll see if they get Cable correct or not.

[Solo: A Star Wars Story](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3778644/) - May 25, 2018. Don't know much about this movie as no trailers have been released yet. I also don't care. I really liked The Last Jedi and would rather see the Star Wars movie franchise move forward with new characters than tell old stories.

[The Incredibles 2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3606756/) - June 15, 2018. Pixar rarely disappoints.

[Jurrassic World: Fallen Kingdom](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4881806/) - June 22, 2018. Nothing will ever beat the first JP movie. I just like seeing dinosaurs on the big screen.

[Ant-Man and the Wasp](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5095030) - July 6, 2018. I'm not a fan of Ant-Man or the Wasp really, but this movie is a big action/comedy piece that fits well in the MCU. It's a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and just go to have fun watching.

[Alita: Battle Angel](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437086/) - July 20, 2018. I read this manga as a teenager way back. I don't remember much, but I welcome more manga/anime based stories into Hollywood.

[The Predator](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3829266/) - August 3, 2018. I will watch anything with Alien or Predator in them. I love the sci-fi/action/horror genre they sit in.

[Venom](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1270797/) - October 5, 2018. Also don't know much about this movie. Fox really screwed up Venom in [Spider-Man 3](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413300/). But it stars [Tom Hardy](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0362766/) who makes good movies. We shall see.

[X-Men: Dark Phoenix](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6565702/) - November 2, 2018. Again, I really dislike what Fox does to the Marvel characters in their movies. They have no plan or vision-- their movies are generally trash. Like Venom, they are trying for the second time with Phoenix.

[Fantastic Beast: The Crimes of Grindelwald](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4123430/) - November 16, 2018. I have to watch it just because it's part of the Potter-verse.

[Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-it Ralph 2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5848272/) -  November 21, 2018. I really enjoyed the first [Wreck-it Ralph](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772341/) movie. But non-Pixar animated sequels tend to be so-so movies that doesn't have the charm of the first.

[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/) - December 14, 2018. Doesn't seem like this animated movie is part of the MCU in any way. Looks good, but Marvel has traditionally released sub-par animated movies compared to DC.

[Aquaman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1477834/) - December 21, 2018. I've given up on the DCEU. But I'll watch the movie anyway.
