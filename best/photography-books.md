I fell in love with photography a bit in high school during my junior/senior year. Throughout college I pretty much ignored my artistic side in favore of learning about computers and computer science. In 2010 I started to use my DSLR to once again enjoy the art of photography and story telling.

I put together this list of books I found very influential in my ongoing education on everything regarding photography. Although to be honest, it was more hand-on approach that was what helps me the most in learning about photography. That and websites, videos, and various online tutorials.
