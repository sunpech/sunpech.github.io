I own quite a few camera bags. These are my favorite that I feel comfortable recommending because I own them.

[Think Tank Retrospective 30, Pinestone](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039ZJ15I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0039ZJ15I&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sunpech-20) - My current favorite camera bag. I take this bag everywhere I go now.

It's light and can carry my camera body, flash, and several lens. The side pouch can also be used to carry a tripod.

[Lowepro Vertex 200 AW Camera/Laptop Backpack](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MULXPO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000MULXPO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sunpech-20) - I love this bag and prefer it over the Fastpack 350. It holds more of my gear and I just feel safer putting my bag down and taking things out rather than swinging a heavier bag around. I highly recommend this bag if you have a lot of stuff to lug around and are strong enough to put it on  your back. It's great for flying and traveling as it easily fits in the overhead compartment.
