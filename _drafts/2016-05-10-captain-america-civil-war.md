This is my [Captain America: Civil War](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/) review that contains **spoilers**, so if you haven't seen the movie yet, please stop reading now! I also provide some insights and predictions on what's to come.

I really liked the movie. Not only does it complete a trilogy of the Captain America movies, it also sets up Phase 3 of the [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) (MCU). The [Russo brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo_brothers) did an excellent job directing some of the best comic book based movies of all time and I can't wait for them to start with the Avengers Infinity War series.

But the movie isn't perfect, I do call into question certain premises and plot lines. Namely, the Sokovia Accords and Baron Zemo's goal to have Iron Man fight Captain America and the Winter Soldier in the third act.

In [the Civil War comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_War_(comics)), a reckless group of enhanced humans gets into a fight resulting in an explosion that kills hundreds of people. This brought about the [Superhuman Registrations Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registration_acts_(comics)#2006_Superhuman_Registration_Act), which within the context for the comics makes sense why Tony Stark would support it. There is an argument to be made that super powered beings should be registered to be kept in check and be held accountable.

Within the movie and MCU, I'm not convinced that Tony Stark and other Avengers would want UN regulation that is the Sokovia Accords. Let's take a look at the characters.

### Iron Man

[Robert Downey Jr.](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000375/) has made Iron Man a much more interesting a character than the comics ever did. In 2008, the [first Iron Man movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/) started us all down a path towards the formation of the Avengers and the Marvel cinematic universe we all love. After the end credits, Nick Fury greets Tony and tells him he's part of a bigger universe, but just didn't know it yet.

In [Iron Man 2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1228705/), the US government wants the Iron Man suit, weapons, and technologies. At the end and throughout the senate hearing, Tony brazenly says no, they can't have it.
