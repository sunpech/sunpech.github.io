This is my [Captain America: Civil War](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/) review that contains **spoilers**, so if you haven't seen the movie yet, please stop reading now! I also provide some insights and predictions on what's to come. I also assume you've seen *all the movies* in the [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) (MCU) to date.

I've watched the movie *twice* now and I really like it. I actually enjoyed it more the second time. Not only does it complete a trilogy of the Captain America movies, it also sets up Phase 3 of the MCU.

The [Russo brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo_brothers) did an excellent job directing some of the best comic book based movies of all time and I can't wait for them to start with the Avengers Infinity War series. I'm amazed with how they handled action movies considering they are known for doing episodes of [Arrested Development](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367279/) and [Community](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1439629/).

### Team Captain America

**I am very much with Steve Rogers-- Captain America.**

Within the context of the MCU's Earth, time and again it's been shown that government and institutions cannot be trusted. The US senate, S.H.I.E.L.D., and the [World Security Council](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/World_Security_Council) (WSC) were all infiltrated by Hydra-- an evil organization with an agenda. I agree with Steve Rogers, *the safest hands is always your own.*

![MCU Hydra](/public/images/blog/mcu-hydra.jpg)

 During the Battle of New York, the WSC's decision was to nuke the city to save the world. In [Captain America: The Winter Soldier](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843866/), the helicarriers seemed like a good idea until S.H.I.E.L.D. was taken over by Hydra and were repurposed to a global massive killing flying battleship. As Nicky Fury stated as to why they were building weapons of mass destruction from the cube (the Tesseract), it because they were hopelessly-- hilariously out-gunned to alien visitors, the Asgardians from [Thor](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800369/).

In [Captain America: The First Avenger](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458339/), Steve Rogers disobeys his commanding officer, Colonel Chester Phillips, and goes off to rescue Bucky and hundred other captured US soldiers. This shows that Rogers not only has a strong friendship with Barnes, but is also willing to do what he felt was right, than be beholden to an authority.

The Sokovia Accords seems to conflict with [the Good Samaritan law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Samaritan_law). Not that it should be used as a blanket excuse for all actions. The question becomes, is the enhanced being acting as a good samaritan/hero, or for some other reason?

### The Incredibles

The issues presented in Civil War is similar to [Disney's The Incredibles](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/). The government is paying for all the court cases and probably all the damage caused in the altercations by *the Supers*. There is also the cost of injuries sustained by the survivors, not to mention the loss of lives. If the Supers didn't reveal their secret identities, the government relocated them and gave them new identities and amnesty so long as they never resume *hero work*.

Despite the rules, Mr. Incredible and Frozone still act as heroes in secret to save people in their free time. If they didn't, people would suffer or die where normal law and rescue could not help.

The office scene with Gilbert Huph (Mr. Incredible) and his boss Bob, there are two sets of dialogue that shows just what can happen when a business or institution has their own agenda against helping people.

##### How Customers Beat the Insurance System:

>**Bob:** Did I do something illegal?

>**Gilbert Huph:** [begrudgingly] No.

>**Bob:** Are you saying we shouldn't help our customers?

>**Gilbert Huph:** [pacing back and forth] The law requires that I answer no.

>**Bob:** We're supposed to help people!

>**Gilbert Huph:** We're supposed to help *our* people! Starting with our stockholders, Bob! Who's helping them out, Huh?

##### A Man Getting Mugged:

>**Gilbert Huph:** Look at me when I'm talking to you, Parr!

>**Bob:** [looking out the window] That man out there, he needs help!

>**Gilbert Huph:** Do not change the subject, Bob! We're discussing your attitude!

>**Bob:** *He* is getting *mugged*!

>**Gilbert Huph:** Well let's hope we don't cover him!

>**Bob:** [leaving] I'll be right back.

>**Gilbert Huph:** Stop right now, or you're fired!

### The Comics

The [Civil War series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_War_(comics)) makes a stronger case for registration and accountability than the MCU. The story starts with a *reckless group* of enhanced humans that gets into a fight resulting in an explosion that killed over 600 people. This was known as the [Stamford Incident](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Stamford), and brought about the [Superhuman Registrations Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registration_acts_(comics)#2006_Superhuman_Registration_Act).

Within the movie and MCU, I'm not convinced that Tony Stark and other Avengers would want UN regulation that is the Sokovia Accords. Let's take a look at the characters.

### Iron Man

[Robert Downey Jr.](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000375/) has made Iron Man a much more interesting a character than the comics ever did. In 2008, the [first Iron Man movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/) started us all down a path towards the formation of the Avengers and the Marvel cinematic universe we all love. In [Iron Man 2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1228705/), the US government wants the Iron Man suit, weapons, and technologies. Tony flat out tells them, "You want my property, you can't have it!". At the end of the movie, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s assessment approved Iron Man for the Avengers Initiative, but not Tony Stark because he had compulsive behavior, prone to self-destructive tendencies, and textbook narcissism.
