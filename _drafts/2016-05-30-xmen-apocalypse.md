I did not care for [X-Men: Apocalypse](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3385516/). This is my spoiler filled review for the movie and it won't be pretty.

[Fox Studios](http://www.foxmovies.com/) just does not understand the underlying story that is the X-Men.

[Bryan Singer](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001741/) seems to ground many of the X-Men from using their powers.

**The appearance of Wolverine as Weapon X is such a gimmick**. It's used to help boost interest with a character many love, but who isn't a main character in the movie. The scene where a young Jean Grey, played by [Sophie Turner](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3849842/), helped Wolverine remove the head gear was just awkward. I'm thankful to [Hugh Jackman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413168/) taking on the challenge of playing Wolverine for all these years, but I'd like to see him hang it up and pass the mantel on to someone else-- or better yet, retire the character for a few years and give a chance for other mutants to shine.

There's no way Angel could ever beat the Blob.

Mystique, played by [Jennifer Lawrence](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2225369/), is again, not a character that is ever front and center in the comics-- her mutant power is attuned to being behind the scenes and espionage.

## X-Men Movies

There have been nine X-Men movies thus far, *and I'm being generous and counting Deadpool as one of them.* Just looking at the movie posters, you can see that six out of the nine have Wolverine in them. The franchise is more like Wolverine and the X-Men, as an after thought.

[X-Men (2000)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120903/) was good for it's time, but it's not a movie I have revisited in the last six years.

[X-Men 2 (2003)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290334/) is better than the first, but also does not stand the test of time.

[X-Men: The Last Stand (2006)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376994/) is the worst movie of them all. It got Jean Grey's Phoenix as well as *all the characters wrong*. It basically spat in the face of the movie and comic fans. I choose to ignore this movie as ever existing.

[X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458525/), despite it's name, was a missed opportunity to tell Wolverine's origin. This movie should have taken place in the past over many decades. The montage of the many wars Wolverine and Sabertooth fought in was the best part of the movie. And of course they got Ryan Reynold's Deadpool completely wrong.

[X-Men: First Class (2011)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1270798/) is probably the best X-Men movie to date. It was a fresh reboot that didn't focus on Wolverine or popular characters for once. And it actually touched upon why humanity would be afraid of mutants-- one of the core story elements to the comics!

[The Wolverine (2013)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1430132/) was very boring movie. How is Wolverine unable to beat a bunch of ninjas?

[X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1877832/) was just okay at best. They centered the movie on the big Hollywood stars, Hugh Jackman and Jennifer Lawrence. The Sentinels looked awful and instead of breaking away from the old cast, they brought them back! At least this movie undid X3.

[Deadpool (2015)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1431045/) is not really an X-Men film, but I enjoyed a proper introduction of Deadpool into the X-Men universe. Their portrayal of Colossus was spot on and showed how you can really have fun with characters with power.
