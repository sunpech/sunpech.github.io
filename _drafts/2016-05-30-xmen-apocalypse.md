description: My review of X-Men Apocalypse. Spoilers and it won't be pretty.

This is my spoiler filled review for the latest X-Men movie. I also talk about all the previous X-Men movies. It won't be pretty.

I did not care for [X-Men: Apocalypse](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3385516/). I went in with low expectations and was still somewhat disappointed with what I saw. This is coming from someone who read some of the X-Men comics as well as watched the [1990s animated series](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103584/).

[Bryan Singer](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001741/) seems to ground his super heroes in reality and avoids anything over-the-top or similar to the comics. The action sequences are all rather plain by today's standards. The final battle was our heroes launching a stream of energy and projectiles at Apocalypse for ten minutes. It's not exciting to see those in battle standing in place with their arms up with the computer graphics (CG) doing most of the work.

**The appearance of Wolverine as Weapon X is such a gimmick**. It's used to help boost interest with a character many love, but who isn't a main character in the movie. The scene where a young Jean Grey, played by [Sophie Turner](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3849842/), helped Wolverine remove the head gear was just awkward. I'm thankful to [Hugh Jackman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413168/) taking on the challenge of playing Wolverine for all these years, but I'd like to see him hang it up and pass the mantel on to someone else-- or better yet, retire the character for a few years and give a chance for other mutants to shine.

Mystique, played by [Jennifer Lawrence](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2225369/), is again, not a character that is ever front and center in the comics-- her mutant power is attuned to being behind the scenes and espionage. But because of her rise to fame in Hollywood, she's given a lead role in the last two X-Men films. Her lines in the movie were poorly written and it didn't seem JLaw was interested in reprising the role and definitely not having the makeup process done to her.

Their depiction of Apocalypse was very disappointing. [Oscar Isaac](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1209966/) is an amazing actor and this role and script was beneath his talent. The costume was not menacing and his human size was rather comical. Everything that made Apocalypse an awesome villain in the comics or TV series was left out.

Cyclops is always a big disappointment in the movies. He's the leader of the X-Men and a straight arrow and borderline difficult to have fun with, but he always keeps the team in check. Yet he always fades into the background behind Wolverine. His love for Jean Grey is monumentally important, especially when it comes to the Phoenix stories, yet it's never been properly portrayed. In this movie he's been reduced to just screaming while he uses his optic blast.

I liked how they *finally* showed that there was a [Danger Room](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Danger_Room) where the X-Men practice and learn to be a team. I know this was shown in X3, but that the Sentinel design was just awful.

The post credits scene with Essex Corp hints at Mr. Sinister and possibly X-23. It's not terribly exciting, as Sinister's origin is tied to Apocalypse, as well as Cable-- it's all terribly complicated. If this is the direction they're going, I hope they can simplify their stories.

QuickSilver, played by [Evan Peters](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1404239/), was the most fun part about the movie. He's actually a good example of how they can have fun with characters and their powers. On top of that, he's is actually more powerful than what I've seen in the comics. It's interesting that Peters and [Aaron Taylor-Johnson](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1093951/) were both in [Kick Ass](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1250777/), and they both play QuickSilver for different studios.

#### Other Issues

* There's no way Angel could ever beat the Blob in the cage scene.
* Moira MacTaggert's line about Nightcrawler being out of energy after the group teleport was just silly. Is this a video game where they have power bars visible?
* How could Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Nightcrawler not get caught when the helicopter landed? They were in a cage that neutralized their mutant powers!
* Why bother having Jubilee in the movie? Her role has been or reduced to a brief appearance every time!
* Who the heck says that Return of the Jedi sucked? No one.
* If Apocalypse really wanted a quick way to wipe out humanity, why not just drop the missiles he launched instead of leaving them in space?

## X-Men Movies

There have been nine X-Men movies thus far, *and I'm being generous and counting Deadpool as one of them.* Just looking at the movie posters, you can see that six out of the nine have Wolverine in them. The franchise is more like Wolverine and the X-Men, as an after thought.

[X-Men (2000)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120903/) was good for it's time, but it's not a movie I have revisited in the last six years.

[X-Men 2 (2003)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290334/) is better than the first, but also does not stand the test of time.

[X-Men: The Last Stand (2006)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376994/) is the worst movie of them all. It got Jean Grey's Phoenix as well as *all the characters wrong*. It basically spat in the face of the movie and comic fans. I choose to ignore this movie as ever existing.

[X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458525/), despite it's name, was a missed opportunity to tell Wolverine's origin. This movie should have taken place in the past over many decades. The montage of the many wars Wolverine and Sabertooth fought in was the best part of the movie. And of course they got Ryan Reynold's Deadpool completely wrong.

[X-Men: First Class (2011)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1270798/) is probably the best X-Men movie to date. It was a fresh reboot that didn't focus on Wolverine or other popular characters for once. It  touched upon why humanity would be afraid of mutants-- one of the core story elements to the comics! They gave a good origins story for Professor X and Magneto. The best part was that they recruited and trained young mutants along with team building, and gave a compelling reason for why mutants would join the antagonist, Sebastian Shaw. A solid movie all around.

[The Wolverine (2013)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1430132/) was very boring movie. How is Wolverine unable to beat a bunch of ninjas?

[X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1877832/) was just okay at best. They centered the movie on the big Hollywood stars, Hugh Jackman and Jennifer Lawrence. The Sentinels looked awful and instead of breaking away from the old cast, they brought them back! At least this movie undid X3.

[Deadpool (2015)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1431045/) is not really an X-Men film, but I enjoyed a proper introduction of Deadpool into the X-Men universe. Their portrayal of Colossus was spot on and showed how you can really have fun with characters with power.

[X-Men: Apocalypse (2015)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3385516/) is on par with X3 in terms of crappiness.

## Final Thoughts

I'd like to see a reboot of the X-Men franchise, minus what we've seen in Deadpool. Get Bryan Singer out and bring in a new director with a better vision. There are other mutants besides Wolverine, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm, Professor X, and Magneto. That's what made First Class great, it broke away from the same core movie X-Men.

Singer also really likes blowing up mansions and destroying bridges. The imagery is over used and has become a joke now.

I have no idea how they will ever do the Phoenix stories. It's complex and involves cosmic beings not of Earth.

Until things change, I will consider the X-Men franchise like the Transformers series, a money grab for studio executives that care very little for the source material. I'm sure many fans will continue to support and enjoy the X-Men movies, and that's fine.
