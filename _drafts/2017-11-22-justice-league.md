I am pretty disappointed in the movie. I already adjusted my expectations that it was a Snyder movie that Joss Whedon was trying to complete or rather save.

Throughout the movie I kept asking myself, *Why are they saying or doing what they are doing?*.

### What I Liked

Gal Gadot still looks amazing as Wonder Woman. Henry Cavil and Ben Affleck also look great as Superman and Batman respectively. That's about it.

### What I Disliked

There's just so much I disliked about the movie. The writing and dialogue was terrible. I kept asking myself why they bothered talking since so much of what was said didn't advance the story or character development. It was really bad.

The characters felt out of place of what I know of the comic book characters.

**Wonder Woman**

**Batman** didn't shine with his skills as a detective.

**Superman**

**Aquaman**

**Flash**

**Cyborg**
