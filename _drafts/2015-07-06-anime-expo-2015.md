I'm currently in California. This past week was [Anime Expo](http://www.anime-expo.org/) in Los Angeles, and this coming week will be [San Diego Comic Con](http://www.comic-con.org/cci) in well, San Diego.

### Day 0

Wednesday is the day many attendees will go pick up their badge. Last year, [I blogged](/2014/07/anime-expo-2014/) about how bad the line was. I personally was in line for 3.5 hours.

This year, I again went for Day 0 badge pick-up and only had to wait in line for a mere 15 minutes. They really improved the badge pick up system by outsourcing it to [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/).

### Day 1

I made the mistake of waiting in line for two hours to get tickets for the Anime Music Video Contest. Turns out, the tickets handed out did not reserve seat or section-- it was all open seating, first come, first serve! I brought a friend to get a ticket just a bit before the event and he was able to get a ticket without any hassle!

So I did miss out on two hours of time I could have been walking around snapping pics of cosplayers! Never again will I wait in line for AMV tickets.

The AMV event itself was good.

### Day 2

This was the Friday, which turned out to be the best day for me in terms of taking pictures of cosplayers. Attendance was high and I was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time to snap a pic of [Jessica Nigri](https://www.facebook.com/OfficialJessicaNigri) in South Hall.

### Day 3

This was actually the 4th of July, Independence day for the United States. The attendance was good, but didn't seem as much as Friday.

### Day 4

The last day I usually take it easy. Like last year, I went around with just a 50mm prime lens and took pictures, mostly portrait style with bokeh.
