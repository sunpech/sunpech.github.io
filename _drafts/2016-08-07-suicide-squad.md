My quick *non-spoiler-y* thoughts on [Suicide Squad](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386697/):

I went in with low expectations, overall, **the movie was just okay**. I was entertained, but not blown away by anything. If you are expecting what you saw the trailers, you are probably going to be disappointed. It's worth a watch if you want to keep up with the DC movie universe, also known as the [DCeU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Extended_Universe).

*Disclaimer: I watched the movie for free with my [T-Mobile Tuesday App](https://explore.t-mobile.com/t-mobile-tuesdays), which gave me free tickets.* I suppose if I had paid money, I would be slightly more disappointed.

Everything below is my *spoiler filled review* of the movie.

## The Good

[Viola Davis](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0205626/) killed it as Amanda Waller. She was absolutely ruthless and I swear the temperature of the theater dropped a few degrees whenever she was on screen.

[Cara Delevingne](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5353321/) looks amazing as the Enchantress. I've always been fascinated with creepy witch-based characters in super hero movies-- the first of which was Scarlett Witch in [Avengers: Age of Ultron](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2395427/) when she stood behind Tony Stark at the beginning of the movie. Throughout the movie I wanted to see more of her and I loved the dark aura they put on her.

## The Okay

**Joker and Harley Quinn were just okay.** It's hard for [Jared Leto](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001467/) to follow [Heath Ledger](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005132/)'s rendition in [Christopher Nolan](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/)'s Batman movies. To add to that, it's also hard for the crazy duo to follow the voice actings of [Mark Hamill](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000434/) and [Tara Strong](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0152839/) for Joker/Quinn. Although I must say that [Margot Robbie](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3053338/) really does look like Harley, but there could be another movie to explore their toxic crazy relationship. It's got potential to be great though.

**El Diablo was a nice touch** and had a good final battle. I think it would have been better if as the demon, he sacrificed himself to take out the Enchantress' brother rather than the underground explosive device. The demon versus monster should have been played up more.

## The Bad

From the numerous trailers that came out, I thought this was going to be a movie they were just going to have fun where bad guys would be tasked to do things the government couldn't ask of anyone else-- yet the movie toned it down, made the *worst of the worse* likable, relatable, and heroic. A team of super villains should contrast deeply with a team of heroes with how they do things right? Not in this movie.

You can really tell which actors the movie editor(s) had obligations to put the spotlight on more than others. Half of the movie's dialogue belongs to [Will Smith](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000226/). Often times I forgot that Killer Croc, Captain Boomerang, Katana, and Slipknot were even in the team-- well the last for obvious reasons.

I liked the short character intro they did at the beginning, but the constant flashbacks of Joker/Harley was really annoying and ruined the pace of the movie. [Ocean's Eleven](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240772/) is an example of how to handle a big cast and deliver a great well paced story where everyone has their moment and backstory told.

The movie had a simple plot-- to rescue the objective, Amanda Waller, and to *save the world* from the main villains, the Enchantress and her brother. There should have been a lot more action, less lines from Will Smith, and less Joker/Harley distractions.

The movie should have been much simpler and dealt with less than end-of-the-world threats. I think Suicide Squad would function better as a heist movie where so many things go wrong and they have to adapt. Anything where the focus is on action and moving the story along instead of slow moments/breaks for flashbacks.

In DC Comics, Suicide Squad is made up of B-grade villains that Batman could fight by himself. They are really out of their league when it comes to fighting some true meta humans that use magic that bullets, bats, and knives aren't lethal.

## Final Thoughts

Suicide Squad is a movie that has problems. The overall story was wrong, the editing was messy, the pacing was slow and didn't match the advertised trailers, and the dialogue was horrendous at times. But I still gave it an okay instead of a thumbs down-- here's why: It's the kind of movie studios should be taking chances on. Mistakes were made, and they should learn from them.
