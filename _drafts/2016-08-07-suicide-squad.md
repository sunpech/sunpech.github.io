My quick *non-spoiler-y* thoughts on [Suicide Squad](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386697/):

**I thought the movie was just okay**, based off low expectations going into it. If you are expecting it to match the trailers, you are probably going to be disappointed. It's worth a watch if you want to keep up with the DC movie universe, also known as the [DCeU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Extended_Universe).

*Disclaimer: I watched the movie for free with my [T-Mobile Tuesday App](https://explore.t-mobile.com/t-mobile-tuesdays), which gave me free tickets.* I suppose if I had paid money, I would be slightly more disappointed.

Everything below is my *spoiler filled review* of the movie.

## The Good

[Viola Davis](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0205626/) killed it as Amanda Waller. She was absolutely ruthless and I swear the temperature of the theater dropped a few degrees whenever she was on screen.

[Cara Delevingne](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5353321/) looked amazing as the Enchantress. I've always been fascinated with creepy witch-based characters in super hero movies-- the first of which was Scarlett Witch in [Avengers: Age of Ultron](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2395427/) when she stood behind Tony Stark at the beginning of the movie.

## The Okay

Joker and Harley Quinn were just okay. It's hard for [Jared Leto](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001467/) to follow Heath Ledger's rendition in Christopher Nolan's Batman movies. To add to that, it's also hard for the crazy duo to follow the voice actings of [Mark Hamill](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000434/) and [Tara Strong](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0152839/) for Joker/Quinn. Although I must say that [Margot Robbie](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3053338/) really does look like Harley, but there could be a full movie to explore their toxic crazy relationship. It's got potential to be great though.

El Diablo was a nice touch and had a great ending-- but it did feel forced upon us at the end. I think it would have been better if as the demon, he sacrificed himself to take out the Enchantress' brother rather than the underground explosive device.

## The Bad

From the numerous trailers that came out, I thought this was going to be a movie they were just going to have fun where bad guys were tasked to do things the government couldn't ask of anyone else-- yet the movie

Half of the movie's dialogue belongs to [Will Smith](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000226/). You can really tell which actors the movie editor(s) had obligations to put the spotlight on more than others.

Killer Croc, Captain Boomerang, and Slipknot were all forgettable characters with a few lines and little screen time.

I liked the short character intro they did at the beginning, but the constant flashbacks of Joker/Harley was really annoying and ruined the pace of the movie. [Ocean's Eleven](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240772/) is an example of how to handle a big cast and deliver a great fast paced story where everyone had their moment and backstory told.

The movie had a simple plot-- to rescue the objective, Amanda Waller, and to *save the world* from the main villains, the Enchantress and her brother. There should have been a lot more action, less lines from Will Smith, and less Joker/Harley distractions.

In DC Comics, Suicide Squad is made up of B-grade villains that Batman could fight by himself. It's probably too much to ask of them to fight
