I enjoyed watching [Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3896198/), it's what a space adventure movie should be! What I especially love about the movie is that every character has his/her moment in the movie. It's a great sequel to the amazing [first movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2015381/).

The movie has FIVE post credit scenes, yes 5, so be sure to stay through the entire credit scroll to catch them all. **This is my spoiler filled review of the movie, so read no further if you haven't watched the movie yet!**

As director [James Gunn](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0348181/) has said, the movie is about family. The relationships between [Peter Quill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-Lord) and his father, [Ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_the_Living_Planet) was explored as the main story arc. But the sister relationship between  [Gamora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamora) and [Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula_(comics)),  as well as [Yondu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yondu) and his former crew, were also explored briefly. I loved this character stories, but there were a lot of characters.

A little over halfway through the movie I was wondering when the main villain would reveal itself and give focus as to what our heroes should be doing. Don't get me wrong, the a Marvel movie actually developed a villain with a backstory this time, but the evil plot dropped in the last twenty minutes of the film.

The movie felt like a series of television episodes cut together where you can see this is Rocket's, Yondu's, or Gamora's arc. The team really only fought together at the beginning and end of the movie. The whole middle was just short character stories.

All of this isn't bad, it just deviates from a more traditional movie story structure by having what seems like a lengthy middle section with short beginning and ending parts. 

### Easter Eggs and Post-credits

There were two scenes that had [The Watchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watcher_(comics)) along with [Stan Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee)'s cameo. Entertaining of course for comic cans, but a part of me wishes that it wasn't a funny bit but more serious since this race only watches/observes things without interfering. With Thanos coming for the Infinity stones, I'd imagine they'd be observing Earth in a major way. I was surprised they were even in the MCU, because [Watcher Uatu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uatu) is part of the Fantastic Four comics, which Fox owns as part of their movie contract. But Marvel probably has rights to use their race, and specifically not Uatu. Perhaps that is the reason it had to be reduced to a cameo rather than the Watcher looking upon Earth's sector from the moon.

[Adam Warlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Warlock) was teased in the second to last post credit scene in the cocoon. In the comics his character is deeply tied into the Infinity soul gem, but I think he's going to be saved for later, post Infinity War movies (Avengers 3 and 4).

### Final Thoughts

I really enjoy the Guardians of the Galaxy and the whole space adventure stories of the MCU. I thought Thor movies would be the ones to tell stories of the cosmic universe in an amazing way, but it was really Guardians of the Galaxy that did that.
