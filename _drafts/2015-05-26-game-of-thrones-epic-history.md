Are you a fan of [Game of Thrones](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/) like I am? Have you checked out [Comic Book Girl 19](https://www.youtube.com/user/comicbookgirl19)'s youTube videos on this book/show?

Well, you should. 

Her videos are quite awesome and very well put together. I previously blogged about [Top 5 YouTube Channels for Comic Geeks](2015/05/top-5-youtube-channels-for-comic-geeks/), and she's listed there as being one of my favorites.

If you can't wait and just want to hit play once, here's Comic Book Girl 19's Game of Thrones videos playlist: [Game of Thrones Videos & GOT Epic Histories Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHZDkFt4F9fNO6XB4L1mi4v-vs96zy53g). Keep in mind the videos are made over a few years. But if you want to just watch some histories of the different houses in Game of Thrones, I posted them individualy below.

Just a warning that she does cover stuff from the books, but I don't consider them super spoiler-y or anything. Just watching the videos makes me enjoy the show more because I have a deeper understanding of what happened in the past.
