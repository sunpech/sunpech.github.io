description: My quick spoilery review of Logan. In short, it's a good movie, but very disconnected from current X-Men movie universe.

I liked the movie, but I didn't love [Logan](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3315342/). It was the best Wolverine movie Fox has made, but that bar is rather low to clear. After 17 years of playing the character, it was a good send off for [Hugh Jackman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413168/). He really made the character his own over the years, despite being different from the comics Wolverine.

### The Good

What I liked about the movie is that it continues to stay true to *Movie Wolverine* character that Jackman has made in his solo movies. His character has always been conflicted about being a team player and helping others unless he really has to. He's lived a long time and has done some terrible things and has lost everyone he's close to. Much like a soldier that's come home from a war with [PTSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder), he can't find peace within.

I enjoyed the R-rating. Thank you [Deadpool](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1431045). A Wolverine has claws that are for ripping through *everything*.

### The Bad

What I disliked is how the movie about the mutants Logan and Charles Xavier, is one where the mutant cause lost. Since Days of Future Past, we know there are multiple timelines. Logan is branch of the [darkest timeline](http://community-sitcom.wikia.com/wiki/Darkest_Timeline) where mutants are gone, Xavier no longer has his X-Men, and the story ends with genetically created mutant children are fleeing because there is no place in the world for them. **There is no hope.**

A movie that is like a one-shot comic that is mostly disconnected from main X-Men movie franchise. It doesn't serve to further the stories of the X-Men and their cause, it serves to pay tribute to Hugh Jackman and [Patrick Stewart](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001772). Both the actors were amazing, but what about Charles' dream of humans and mutants coexisting? There is no story about the humanity redeeming itself in any way, just death.

### The Miscellaneous

I enjoy movie violence, but was anyone else bothered by how the children teamed up to kill Donald Pierce, played by [Boyd Holbrook](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2933542/)? His death was a team effort of kids surrounding him using all their powers at once.

Seeing Laura (X-23), played by [Dafne Keen](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6748436/) kill and maim soldiers was really fun. I do wish she had more lines to develop her relationship with Logan more. Hope there's a director's cut!

### Final Thoughts

Like any movie, Logan has things to like and dislike.
