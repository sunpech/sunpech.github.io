There is a saying that if you are a comic fan or even a reading aficionado, that you should buy your books from your local comic/book store to support the community. In some ways I agree with this, but in many other ways I do not. Simply put, I've come across stores that aren't helpful, rude, doesn't understand customers, price gouges, or just doesn't carry what I want.


### Barnes and Nobles - Unhelpful and Not in Stock

I went to Barnes and Noble yesterday to pick up the latest issue of [Cosplay Culture magazine](http://www.cosplaymagstore.com/). After finding the magazines I wanted, I went to browse the graphic novels section. In the past I found B&N to have a good selection of not only American graphic novels, but Japanese (manga) ones as well. But to my surprise I found everything there to be incredibly disorganized with various gaps between volumes, missing just released titles, and not even carrying some of the best stories many comic fans recommend. They had a deal where if you buy two DC or Marvel graphic novel, you get a third for free. **The problem was that B&N didn't carry *at least* three books I wanted to buy.** I could only find a total of two off my Amazon wish list that I was willing to *impulse* buy to meet the deal requirement. Understandably, even with the deal, Amazon's prices are still cheaper-- but it's really hard to beat Amazon's prices with their razor thin profit margins.

Another time at B&N involved me wanting to buy a few copies Cosplay Culture magazine, which I [had photos in](/2015/09/my-photos-in-cosplay-culture-magazine/). My sister called a them to ask if they carried copies of the magazine, and if they could check their stands. The representative responded that they had so many magazines that she couldn't find it.... Really? How is it that you work in a bookstore and can't figure out if you carry a magazine? Options would be to look it up in the computer system inventory, physically browse the magazine racks by category, or even ask another employee. Shocked by this unwillingness to help us find a way to be a potential customer, we said we would just go there to check ourselves-- and guess what, within 1 minutes I was able find the magazine.

### Local Comic Shops - Price inflation and Racism

When I lived in Los Angeles, I used to go to a local comic shop for my comic subscription. For those of you unfamiliar, a subscription at a comic store is where you sign up to have them set aside books for you every Wednesday so you can just come in and have the books ready. Generally this requires at least 4-6 different monthly titles.

Some of the comics I had a subscription to had [variant covers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_cover) issued by the publisher. In particular, [Valiant Entertainment](http://www.valiantentertainment.com/) among others would give more variant covers to a shop depending on how much they order-- the more they order, the more of a variant cover they would receive. Many times there would be more than one variant cover-- but a more common variant would be attainable because even a lower order of comics would qualify for them. The point of these variants would be to reward the comic shop and their customers for being a fan. The more rare variants would be marked up-- which is fine. But the common variants at a particular shop would be marked up a few bucks. This was annoying since just a few blocks away another comic shop would sell them at cover price to their customers. **This was obvious price gouging.** At all other comic shops in the LA area would sell the common variants at cover price because they understood that any fan could request this common variant cover.

At another LA comic shop I was witness to some very rude and racial remarks by the comic shop's employee or employee's friend who always happened to be there. I won't repeat what was said, but it was something that should't have been said in a public setting full of customers. Now, yes the world is a mean place and people aren't always going to say things you like and free speech-- I get that, but it doesn't mean an individual can't react by deciding not shop there anymore.

I ended up never returning to either of these local comic shops again. These were the two closest comic shops at two different apartments I lived at in Los Angeles too.

### Good Shops do Exist

I'm not saying all brick and mortar shops provide a poor experience. There are a small handful of places that I've come to enjoy because they put customer relationship first. The LA comic shops I really liked were a little over 30 minute drive away, not quite local when it costs more time and gas to get to.

### The Amazon Experience

Shopping on Amazon is great when you know what it is you want. When you know the title, author, or even category, your search terms is all you need to help you find the things you want.
