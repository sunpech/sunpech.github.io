I attended [Anime Central](http://www.acen.org), also known as ACen, this past weekend for the first time. I was able to secure a press pass and attended all three days. My main goal was to take photos of cosplayers in and out of the [Donald E. Stephens Convention Center](http://www.rosemont.com/desconvention/).

ACen is Chicago's and the Midwest's largest anime, manga, and Japanese pop culture convention. As I've read and heard, it's the third, or even second largest anime convention now, second only to [Anime Expo](http://www.anime-expo.org/).

I had a great time taking photos and was surprised by the number of people after the formal con hours. It seemed as though the post-con parties was when things really took off. After a full day of walking and taking photos, I was too pooped for anything! But it looked immensely fun for all in attendance.

**I really like how ACen has the artist alley near the front**-- before many of the exhibitors. Most other conventions puts the artists to the side or the back where many convention goers may miss a lot of creative and/or local talent.

**ACen's gaming rooms are incredible.** They had rooms for a [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com) tournament, a *free* arcade room, retro games/gaming consoles, as well as more classical board and card game rooms. ACen offers games for which ever kind of gamer you are-- and if not, you can bring your own and find people to play with you. What was also pretty sweet was the community of people willing to teach you how to play a game.

### Cosplay

I was impressed with the quality of cosplay at ACen. I didn't think I would find great subjects to photograph. However, many of the great cosplayers I saw didn't hang out in the main lobby. A few of them were in the hotel lobby or outside near the gatherings and meetups. I walked back and forth all day long. To put it in context, I walked more on Friday than on any single day at [San Diego Comic Con](http://www.comic-con.org/cci).
