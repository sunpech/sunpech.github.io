This past weekend I attended [Anime Central](http://www.acen.org), also known as ACen, for the first time. I was given a press pass and attended all three days. My main goal was to take photos of cosplayers in and out of the [Donald E. Stephens Convention Center](http://www.rosemont.com/desconvention/).

ACen is the Midwest's largest anime, manga, and Japanese pop culture convention. As I've read, it's [the third](http://animecons.com/articles/article.shtml/1484/Ten_Largest_North_American_Anime_Conventions_of_2015) largest anime convention, but I've also heard it's the second now, behind [Anime Expo](http://www.anime-expo.org/) (AX).

I was surprised by the number of people after the formal con hours. It seems as though the post-con parties is where the con really kicks things up. I've heard some con-goers compare ACen to [Dragoncon](http://www.dragoncon.org/), in the sense that it runs around the clock through the weekend. After a full day of walking and taking photos, I was too pooped for anything!

**I really like how ACen has the artist alley near the front**, before many of the exhibitors. Most other conventions puts the artists to the side or the back where many convention goers may miss a lot of creative and/or local talent. Putting artist alley front/center allows most traffic to flow through and discover stuff you wouldn't find easily online.

**ACen's gaming rooms are incredible.** They had rooms for a [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com) tournament, a *free* arcade room, retro games/gaming consoles, as well as more classical board and card game rooms. ACen offers games for which ever kind of gamer you are-- and if not, you can bring your own and find people to play with you. What was also pretty sweet was the community of people willing to teach you how to play a game.

### Cosplay

I was impressed with the quality of cosplay at ACen. I didn't think I would find such great subjects to photograph. I say this because I'm used to attending AX where the bar for cosplay is pretty high.

However, many of the great cosplayers I saw didn't hang out in the main lobby. A few of them were in the hotel lobby or outside near the gatherings and meetups. I walked back and forth all day long-- to put it in context, I walked more on Friday at ACen than on any day at [San Diego Comic Con](http://www.comic-con.org/cci) last year. For future reference, I walked just under 12 miles.

## Final Thoughts

My favorite cons to go to are San Diego Comic Con and Anime Expo, but they're both in California. If you can't attend those cons, give ACen a try. You don't have to be an anime or manga fan to enjoy what they have to offer. I do notice a trend of dancing at many anime conventions-- and if that's your thing, you'll love ACen's dance culture.

There are a few things that I think they could do to improve the overall con experience:

1. Security - I never saw a weapons check booth. Plus many security guards were very lax on where people could enter/exit.
2. Traffic Police - At the con there seemed to be enough traffic guards, but the intersections just one block North and South on River Road didn't have sufficient guidance for cars. This may be out of the hands of ACen staff though.
3. Cosplay - There are a lot of cosplayers just hanging out everywhere, there should be sections with backdrops with the ACen logos for photo ops. This should be in the main lobby where everyone hangs out anyway.

I think Anime Central is a great convention. I'd like to see it grow and offer anime, comic, and entertainment fans even more great panels, guests, and shows. I am reminded every time I attend a convention that I'm getting old. My first comic convention was in 1995, more than twenty years ago. Being a geek today has never been so good, and it keeps getting better.
