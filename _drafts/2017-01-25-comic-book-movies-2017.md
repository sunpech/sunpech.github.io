Last year I wrote a post about [Super Hero Movies of 2016](/2016/01/super-hero-movies-of-2016). I wanted to do the same for 2017, as it looks to be another amazing year for comic fans.

## My 2017 Rankings

1. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (May 5, 2017)
2. Wonder Woman (June 2, 2017)
3. Thor: Ragnorok (November 3, 2017)
4. Justice League (November 17, 2017)
5. Spiderman: Homecoming (July 7, 2017)
6. Logan (March 3, 2017)

This is the ranking, 1-6, ranked from most looking forward to, to least.

### Logan

I cannot get my excited about another Wolverine movie, [Logan](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3315342/), from Fox. It has everything to do with the fact that I haven't enjoyed a single standalone Wolverine movie. There was [X-men Origins: Wolverine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458525/) in 2009, which was a missed opportunity to tell a good origin story, not to mentioned they totally messed up Deadpool. In 2013, [The Wolverine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1430132/) was boring and the scene that really bothered me was how Wolverine was unable to beat ninjas in the snow.

Most of the X-Men franchise has rested on Hugh Jackman's shoulders. I thank him for his portrayal and years of dedication, but I'd like to see him retire the role to someone else. I think that's what this movie is, if anything that's what I look forward to. I think it's best I go in with low expectations.

Release date: March 3, 2017

### Wonder Woman

June 2, 2017

### Spiderman: Homecoming

Similar to the Wolverine character in movies, I also have a hard time looking forward to seeing Spiderman on the big screen. There's just been too many bad movies and reboots. I liked seeing Tom Holland in Civil War, but that was just a small intro/tease of a young, sarcastic, and funny Spiderman.
