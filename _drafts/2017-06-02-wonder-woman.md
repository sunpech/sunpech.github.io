I was really looking forward to the [Wonder Woman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0451279/) movie. I think many feel, myself included, that this movie is important for the DCEU to turn things around in setting up their universe. After watching the movie, **I'm not sure the movie helped or hurt their universe.**

**The movie was at best, just okay for me.** I enjoyed several aspects of the movie, but had issues with many others. My disappointment may very well be because I've been waiting for a Wonder Woman film for a long time, and I wanted them to do really well with it. To use a sportsball term, they didn't drop the ball, but they didn't make a home-run or touchdown.

## The Good

The story was simple, which I like for origin movies. Act I tells the mythology and history of the Amazons along with introduce Steve Trevor and the world of man. Act II is Wonder Woman journeys into the world war looking for Ares and interacts more with Trevor, his war gang, and Wonder Woman further discovers her capabilities. Act III is the big reveal of Ares and their big fight.

I liked how the movie payed homage to not just classic superhero movies, but great movies in general.

## The Bad

Since the story was simple, I didn't see the need for the misdirect with who was Ares, the god of war.

There were several scenes where the dialogue was just poorly written. Also, [Gal Gadot](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2933757/) looks great as Wonder Woman, but her acting chops wasn't great at times, or they didn't do enough takes to get the best scenes from her. [Chris Pine](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1517976/) I had issue with too at times where the lines they said was flat and didn't have emotions, which may have a lot do with the script just being sub-par. This happened throughout the movie and took me out of the adventure and had me asking myself, "Did they just say that?". Very distracting.



## Final Thoughts

I really wanted to spend more time on Themyscira and see more about Wonder Woman's relationship with the Amazons, their culture, and mythology/history, than with World War I.

We've had so many Superman and Batman movies, they both had their origin stories retold many times, yet Wonder Woman's origin in terms of her childhood upbringing was far too short.

### YouTubers Reviews

I don't agree with a lot of the reviewers for this movie, but some of them bring up good points.
