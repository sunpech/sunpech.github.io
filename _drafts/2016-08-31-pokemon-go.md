I've been playing [Pokemon Go](http://www.pokemongo.com/) for almost two months now and I really enjoy the game. Age-wise, I am on the older side of fan base, as I watched the TV show when I was college between classes with other friends. I think a good majority of fans watched/played the Pokemon shows/games when they were kids in the late 90s to early 2000s.

**This post is a quick guide for those of you that want to get into this Pokemon Go craze.** I assume that you've already installed and played the game a bit and are familiar with the in-game terminology. By no means is it a complete guide to everything, as many out there are still discovering new things all the time, on top of [Niantics Labs](https://www.nianticlabs.com/) is still tweaking the game.

*Note: Just because I recommend against something, if you find that it's fun, then ignore my advice. This game can be played in many ways for fun. **I optimize my game around value and the long game (levels 30+).***

**Also, there are haters and jokers that give grief on the game, but if you are going outside, getting exercise, socializing, and most importantly having fun, then I encourage you to ignore them.** *Pokemon Go is for everyone.* I've seen players as in the single digit age, teens, high school kids, college kids, parents, and even older play the game in parks, river walks, malls, and in their cars.

I enjoy the game for the *health benefits of getting my steps in every day* with my [Fitbit Charge](https://www.fitbit.com/charge). I'm fitting in between 10,000 to 20,000 steps every day and occasionally chat with other players I find.

*I also love the strategies involved to be the best in the game* that involves some math, spreadsheet knowledge, and a lot of patience.

## Top 5 Tips

If you don't want to read this entire post, here is the TL;DR; section for those of you just starting out and/or want to improve.

1. Focus on leveling your trainer from levels 1-20.
2. Save your stardust-- don't power-up any Pokemon until you're level 25+, ideally level 30+.
3. Capture as much Pokemon you can-- *gotta catch'em all.*
4. Hatch eggs, especially after level 20.
5. Avoid gyms, unless they're convenient.

## Pokecoins and Pokeshop

In US dollars, roughly 100 Pokecoins (PC) equals $1, at it's worse rate. At the best rate, it's 145 PC per US dollar. Either way, it's about 1 cent = 1 Pokecoin.

*If you are going to spend money on anything consistently, I recommend it be on **lucky eggs** and **incubators**.*

Lucky eggs are great for leveling your trainer up. It's time based-- 30 minutes where any XP earned is doubled!

Lure Modules are good if you want to be the one to use/share them-- but for the most part I just bum off others.

Egg Incubators are great for hatching eggs for the daily walks.

When you get to higher levels, you'll probably need to upgrade your bag and Pokemon storage. Each one increases the amount by 50. You can always transfer Pokemon back to the professor if your Pokestorage is filling up, or discard items from your bag if it's full-- in general I toss my lowest level potions as each counts as one item whether it heals a Pokemon for 20 or 200.

## Leveling Up

The fastest way to level up your trainer is to use a lucky egg and do mass evolutions. The best Pokemon to evolve are the ones you have many of, which are typically: pidgies, weedles, caterpies, and rattatas. These are abundant for most players and are also low candy cost to evolve (12, 12, 12, and 25 respectively).

Each evolution normally gives you 500 experience (XP), but with a lucky egg it doubles to 1000 XP!

Here's where some math comes into play. For each new Pokemon you add to your storage, you get 2 of its candies. If you trade it in, you get 1 candy of its kind. So each Pokemon you capture is worth at least 3 candies. The only time it's worth more is if you hatch it from an egg, by which you are given a random amount.

Check out [PidgyCalc](http://www.pidgeycalc.com/) if you want help to calculating how much/many and if it's worth using a lucky egg for 30 minutes to earn the maximum potential.

You can also time your lucky egg with the egg hatchings from incubators and/or with new Pokemon to add to the Pokedex.

## What to Evolve

## Independent Values (IVs)


## Gyms

Unless you battle and take over gyms strictly for fun, gyms are mostly a waste of energy, money, and time in terms of value earnings. Having a gym and *cashing out* your reward nets you only 500 stardust and 10 PCs. That's equivalent of capturing 5 Pokemon and $0.10 US. **There's more value in spending money to buy Pokecoins and incubators to hatch eggs while you walk to capture Pokemon you find.**

The game is currently designed for high gym turnover, the advantage is always with the attacker, not the defender. Typically easy to access gyms will go down quickly within minutes in populated areas. If you want to hold a gym for longer period of time, a few days, you need to capture a gym with low foot traffic, or in more rural areas. You'll have to leave a Pokemon there, which will also be inaccessible while it's there-- no power ups, evolutions, or trade-ins until it is defeated!
