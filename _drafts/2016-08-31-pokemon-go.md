I've been playing [Pokemon Go](http://www.pokemongo.com/) for almost two months now and I really enjoy the game. Age-wise, I am on the older side of fan base, as I watched the TV show when I was college between classes with other friends. I think a good majority of fans watched/played the Pokemon shows/games when they were kids in the late 90s to early 2000s.

**This post is a quick guide for those of you that want to get into this Pokemon Go craze.** The number of downloads/players grew and spiked, but has declined greatly as they game lost some steam. The game is still being released world-wide and has some growth.

**There are haters and jokers that give grief on the game, but if you are going outside, getting exercise, socializing, and most importantly having fun, then I encourage you to ignore them.** *Pokemon Go is for everyone.* I've seen players as in the single digit age, teens, high school kids, college kids, parents, and even older play the game in parks, river walks, malls, and in their cars.

I enjoy the game for the *health benefits of getting my steps in every day* with my [Fitbit Charge](https://www.fitbit.com/charge). I'm fitting in between 10,000 to 20,000 steps every day and occasionally chat with other players I find. *I also love the strategies involved to be the best in the game* that involves some math, spreadsheet knowledge, and a lot of patience.

## Top 5 Tips

If you don't want to read this entire post, here is the TL;DR; section for those of you just starting out and/or want to improve.

1. Focus on leveling your trainer from 1-20.
2. Save your stardust-- don't power-up any Pokemon until you're level 25+, ideally level 30.
3. Capture as much Pokemon you can
4. Hatch eggs, especially after level 20.
5. Avoid gyms.



### Pokecoins and Pokeshop

In US dollars, roughly 100 Pokecoins (PC) equals $1, at it's worse rate. At the best rate, it's 145 PC per US dollar. Either way, it's about 1 cent = 1 Pokecoin.

If you are going to spend money on anything consistently, I recommend it be on lucky eggs and incubators.
**Lucky eggs are great for leveling your trainer up.** Lure Modules are good if you want to be the one to use them-- but for the most part I just bum off others that set them up. **Egg Incubators are great for hatching eggs for the daily walks.**

When you get to higher levels, you'll probably need to upgrade your bag and Pokemon storage. Each one increases the amount by 50.

### Gyms

Unless you battle and take over gyms strictly for fun, gyms is mostly a waste of energy, money, and time in terms of value earnings.
