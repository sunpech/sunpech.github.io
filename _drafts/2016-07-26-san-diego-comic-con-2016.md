Just got back from [San Diego Comic Con](http://www.comic-con.org/cci) and I'm super exhausted! My sisters and I were lucky this year and we got rooms at the [Manchester Grand Hyatt](http://manchester.grand.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html), just a few blocks away from the convention center. I even nabbed myself a [Superman Conan FunkoPop](https://www.instagram.com/p/BIIbAwrjP9A/) that was being raffled away in the very same hotel we were staying at!

The weather was hot as the sun was unforgiving most of the time during the day. I mostly stayed inside taking photos and walking the floor. So I don't have many pics of the off-site and outside events, as it was just too damn hot!

## The Good

### Pokemon Go
**If you played PoGo, then no doubt you would be staring at your phone and playing all the time.**

[Pokemon Go](http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-go/) was an extremely popular mobile game at Comic Con this year. I'd guess that about a third of the people were playing it. At many of the pokestops, lure modules were going off non-stop. I personally enjoyed catching a bunch of new Pokemon and leveling up to 23 doing some mass evolves with a lucky egg.

I went to the Niantic Labs panel, *Re-Imaging Reality: Bringing Games Into the Real World With Ingress and Pokemon Go*, in Hall H on Sunday where the founde, John Hanke, revealed the team leaders. There was [a rumor](https://twitter.com/nerdist/status/757299843362455552) that a legendary Pokemon would drop in Hall H-- which turned out to be just that, a rumor. The vibe I got was that they wouldn't make such Pokemon available until the game is fully released worldwide.

### Marvel and DC

The [Wonder Woman Comic Con trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46gQ869ejMM) looked amazing, also the [Justice League trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zhENoYrkZk) was also good. Ths shows how the [DCEU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Extended_Universe), Warner Brothers, is making corrections from Snyder's gritty universe with Superman.

Marvel did well too with a new [Doctor Strange trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzx-zryEgM) along with the official announcement that [Brie Larson is the new Captain Marvel](https://www.instagram.com/p/BIOkQm_Bvl5/). I heard that Guardians of the Galaxy 2 exclusive footage also looked great.

Netflix is rocking it with [The Defenders teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBZtM8q2Z1g).

**So basically everything from Marvel and DC looks good in terms of TV and movies.**

## The Bad

**Security and staff/volunteer training is getting worse.**

It's becoming a media circus and the mobs of fans that crowd the booths to see their movie and TV stars is getting to be ridiculous. In previous years I would be able to go take quick photos and go about my business. Now it's a crowd rush where I am stuck a tight crowd of hundreds of fans for 30-40 minutes. The fans are becoming unruly and pushy, and worst of all the security are less professional. **A few security guards actually makes the situation worse by being aggressive and taunting the crowd.**

Comic Con is basically line con-- there are lines for everything. I normally don't get in lines for anything because I know it's not worth it. Well, I was reminded of that when I was line a the [American Gods](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1898069/) booth, or at least what I thought was the line. I asked the end of the line volunteer if this was the end of the line for the booth, he said "yes". So I get in line and wait about 5-10 minutes when a more senior staff member brings another group of people, tells everyone in line to step back from the booth, and tells us all to go to the end of the line along the wall. Basically, the 40-50 people waiting in line at the booth, weren't really in line because no staff there could direct or coordinate things. I just left, reminded once again that it's not worth getting in line for something unless you are really interested or are buying something.


## Pictures

### Out and About

The amount of off site events is growing-- essentially making the entire city of San Diego a comic convention. However, because it was so hot, I did not go to visit many of the sites because waiting in line in sun for hours is just a bad idea.

### Cosplay

The quality of the cosplay is improving, but there doesn't seem to be as many people cosplaying like in previous years. This might just be because Comic Con is becoming more mainstream and many cosplayers are unable to get tickets like before.
