I like to read books on some of the best entrepreneurs of modern times. Everyone from Bill Gates, Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Tony Hsieh, Jason Fried, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, to Steve Jobs. I really enjoy reading how they think and what they did to build the businesses they did.

The latest book I read was, [Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062301233/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0062301233&linkCode=as2&tag=sunpech-20&linkId=DBEJPF4ZP7PKKX4U) by [Ashlee Vance](http://www.amazon.com/Ashlee-Vance/e/B003YLHAJG/). I find Elon Musk to be a fascinating person who's building the businesses of the future.

### Favorite Excerpts

> "Zip2, PayPal, Tesla, SolarCity-- they are all expressions of Musk. SpaceX is Musk. ... Part of it stems from SpaceX being the apotheosis of the Cult of Musk. Employees fear Musk. They adore Musk. They give up their lives for Musk, and they do all of this simultaneously." (p. 218)

> "SpaceX and Musk also seem to inspire an unusual level of loyalty. Musk has managed to conjure up that Steve Jobs-like zeal among his troops." (p. 222)

> "It's almost a binary experience for him. Either you're trying to make something spectacular with no compromises or you're not. And if you're not, Musk considers you a failure." (p 297)

> "Elon's worst trait by far, in my opinion, is a complete lack of loyalty or human connection." "Many of us worked tireless for him for years and were tossed to the curb like a piece of litter without a second thought." -- former employee (p. 340)
