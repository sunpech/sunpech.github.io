This past weekend I was at [Anime Central](https://www.acen.org) (ACen) at the [Donald E. Stephens Convention Center](http://www.rosemont.com/desconvention/). This was my second time attending, and I was given a press pass once again.

I stuck around the main entrance hall for most of the convention hoping to catch cosplayers on the way in or out of the exhibit hall. It seemed this year a lot of cosplayers were more casual and spent more time in the exhibit hall than the entrance. That, or they were hanging out more at the [Hyatt Regency Hotel](https://ohare.regency.hyatt.com), which is a hotspot for cosplayers.

Music and dancing are a big part of ACen. There are always groups or individuals dancing or practicing moves somewhere in the main lobby. There's also a few musicians playing a flute or violin somewhere while they hang out with friends.

I remember seeing these girls dance last year, their Instagram handles are: [@pink_caramell](http://instagram.com/pink_caramell) and [@pearlpurrmaid](http://instagram.com/pearlpurrmaid).

### Cosplay

There was a lot of rain at this year's ACen, so the cosplay gatherings moved inside during those days.

I was lucky enough to grab this panorama shot of the DC cosplay gathering on Friday when it wasn't too crowded yet. Most other gatherings, especially on Saturday, are way too crowded to jump in for a quick shots-- getting there early is encouraged.

**The cosplay gatherings are becoming more organized every year.** Just about every cosplay gathering will have someone designated as a *countdown person*, who's job it is to countdown from five or ten how long the cosplayers and photographers have to to hold poses or take pictures before the next set will start.
