I loved [Star Wars The Last Jedi](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2527336/). The movie is brilliant. I've only watched it once as of this posting and I plan on watching it a few more times to catch all the little things I may have missed. 

Spoilers below of course.

## Empire and Return

The movie has similarities to both [Empire Strikes Back](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/) and [Return of the Jedi](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086190/).

The dark tones are similar to Empire. The failure of Luke Skywalker and the entire Jedi Order was touched upon. By the end of the movie, the Resistance *aka Rebels* were crushed to a group that fits on the Millennium Falcon.

Snoke's character and throne room was reminiscent of Emperor Palpatine's. Him bringing Kylo and Rey to fight each other also a callback to Return of the Jedi.

Our heroes took their hits just like in Empire, and it ended with a view out into the stars with hope.

## New and Different

The Last Jedi also introduced new characters in a story that had so many twists and turns that I could not predict anything! It's been a while since I watched a Star Wars movie or TV show where I just enjoyed the ride instead of trying to read through the plot.

I really liked how they focused on other characters besies the Jedi. There are other heroes in the stories besides those that are force users. [Poe Dameron](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Poe_Dameron), best pilot in the Resistance has his struggles with leadership. [Finn](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Finn), a First Order defector-- has some qualm with [Captain Phasma](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Phasma), although his origin story is still unexplored. [Rose](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Rose_Tico), a maintainance worker that admired Resistance heroes from afar and also lost her sister [Paige](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Paige_Tico).

## Fans be Hating

Star Wars fans are never happy with movies. From Jar Jar Binks, the script's bad dialogue, too much CGI, too many added scenes, Han shot first, etc-- fans have complained about everything. They even put forth a petition to remove the movie from canon. See: [Fans Start Petition To Remove 'The Last Jedi' From 'Star Wars' Canon](http://comicbook.com/starwars/2017/12/18/star-wars-the-last-jedi-canon-petition-/). *Note, the OP has since stepped back from the petition and urges others to find better causes.*

The biggest complaint is how Luke Skywalker was portrayed. Some say he would never think to kill or hurt his nephew. Luke would never think his nephew Kylo would be unredeemable, considering what Luke went through with his own father Darth Vader.

I can see that. Luke Skywalker is a childhood hero of mine. I was old enough to remember going to watch Return of the Jedi in the movie theater with my uncle. All I remember back then was the lightsabers.

But Luke is not without flaws.
