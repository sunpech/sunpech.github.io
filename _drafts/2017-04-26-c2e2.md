This past weekend I went to [C2E2](http://www.c2e2.com) over at [McCormick Place](http://www.mccormickplace.com/). Once again I wasn't able to obtain a press pass, so I went as a *civilian* photographer-- I bought my 3-day pass. Every year I'm going to try, and every year I'm probably going to get denied!

C2E2 isn't too big that it's uncomfortable to go as an individual or even as a family. McCormick Place is huge and there's plenty of room to expand in case the crowd size does ever get bigger. I've been to [San Diego Comic Con](http://www.comic-con.org/cci), and the show floor you are often walking shoulder to shoulder, back to back on the industry side of the hall. It is crowded and often uncomfortable.

I go to C2E2 for three reasons:

1. Celebrity guest spotlights
2. Comic/Industry panels
3. Cosplay

### Celebrity Spotlights

This year I spent more time at the main stage and panels than on the show floor taking photos of cosplayers. The main stage is where they do almost all the celebrity spotlight panels. It's a big room that seats about 700-800 people. I really like how the main stage doesn't restrict attendees from walking around to take photos. So I was able to move all around the room to take photos with my 70-200mm zoom.

The moderator for most of the spotlight panels was [Clare Kramer](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004456/). She did an amazing job as usual.

Most main stage panels are easy to get into. There are usually a few that are very popular that do fill to capacity. The two I wasn't able to attend because of that were the Stan Lee/Frank Miller and the Agents of SHIELD spotlights. Something was also wrong with the projector that caused some delay and threw off my schedule.

#### Wil Wheaton

The conversation with [Wil Wheaton](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000696/) was vast, everything from table top gaming to mental health. I think at one point he pointed out that he was the *cheaper or less expensive version of Chris Hardwick* or something to that liking. Funny!

#### Zachary Levi

I confess that I've never watched an episode of [Chuck](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0934814/) before. But I do know [Zachary Levi](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1157048/) from his role as Fandral from the Thor movies. He is a funny man that can entertain a room by himself-- no need for a moderator because he can move the conversation along by himself with fans.

#### Jason David Frank

I was never a fan of [The Might Morphin Power Rangers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106064/) US tv show. I used to watch the original Japanese show whenever I visited Thailand as a kid and just couldn't get into the US version.

That said, I admire how much [Jason David Frank](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0290969/) works to connect with his fans. He does a lot of conventions every year and is able to be grateful and enthusiastic the whole time.

#### Michael Cudlitz

Best known as Abraham from [The Walking Dead](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1520211/), [Michael Cudlitz](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0191044/) is not forgotten. Sorry spoilers!

#### Frank Miller

[Frank Miller](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0588340/) is comic icon. From writing, drawing, to directing, this guy has done just about everything. I really enjoyed his Sin City books as well as his original [Dark Knight Returns](http://amzn.to/2pm4eX1) books.

#### Vincent D'Onofrio

[Vincent D'Onofrio](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000352/) has starred in so many movies I've enjoyed over the years. His latest is as Wilson Fisk (Kingpin) in [Daredevil](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3322312/).

#### Millie Bobby Brown

The [Millie Bobby Brown](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5611121/) panel was one of my favorites! Like everyone else, I'm a big fan of the hit show, [Stranger Things](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/)! Her character, [Eleven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleven_(Stranger_Things) was amazing and I can't wait for Season 2!

I can't believe she's only 13 years old! She holds herself up so well for being so young. The stories she shared was incredibly funny too!

A few things she said:

* She loves the 1980s and thinks it was a wonderful and safe time compared to today.
* Some of her favorite movies are [E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083866/) and [The Goonies](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089218/).
* When she hung out with older celebrities, when they were drunk they would give her their cell phone numbers.
* The Cubs hat she wore just for Chicago fans. She saw it at the airport and her dad went and bought her one.

#### Mike Colter

I thought it was hilarious how many guys were hitting on [Mike Colter](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1591496/) at his spotlight panel. The running joke was that they were asking him out for *coffee*, as in it's just *coffee*. Inside joke, you need to have watched [Luke Cage](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3322314/) to get it.

### Comic/Industry Panel

The only comic book related panel I went to was the one held by [Comicstorian](https://www.youtube.com/user/comicstorian) and [ComicsExplained](https://www.youtube.com/user/fluidicbeats).

### Cosplay

I spent maybe 20% of my time on the floor taking photos of cosplayers. The bulk 80% was in panels and the main stage. I generally avoid the main floor because it has the ugly red carpet with horrible lighting.

The cosplay, year after year, is just getting better. The work that goes into the costumes really shows, and the cosplayers are becoming pros at posing for the camera. It's a real treat to be a part of it all.

Although I have to admit that half of the cosplay I see I don't even know where it's from. They pull from so many different genres and stories that I cannot keep up.
