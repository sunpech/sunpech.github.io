Over the weekend I saw [Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2975590/). In a nutshell, I thought it was okay, but not great-- nor does it match the hype.  **This post does contain SPOILERS, so don't read any further if you haven't seen it yet or don't mind!**

You've been warned....

I [reviewed Man of Steel](/2013/06/man-of-steel-review) several years ago and gave it a generally positive review for a *sci-fi Superman* reimagining. I compared its grittiness to [Injustice: Gods Among Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injustice:_Gods_Among_Us), and Batman V Superman followed the same tone. And it's not suprising, given the the director was [Zack Snyder](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0811583/). He was the producer and/or director for a number of films with a dark tone such as [300](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416449/), [Watchmen](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409459/), and [Sucker Punch](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0978764/). It's as if DC executives liked [Christopher Nolan](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/)'s Batman films so much that they decided to make the entire DC cinematic universe in a similar fashion.

There was also an excessive amount of trailers for this movie that gave away so much of the story. You could have missed the first half of the film and gotten by on the trailers alone to enjoy the second half.

[Ben Affleck](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000255/)'s Batman was one of the best parts of the film. It's as if they lifted the Dark Knight straight out of [Frank Miller](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0588340/)'s work. The action sequences, Batman's altered voice and detective skills, and the costume designs all exceeded my expectations. The interactions between Affleck and [Jeremy Irons](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000460/) may be the most accurate depiction of the Batman/Alfred relationship on the big screen to date. It seems as though too much of the film focused on Batman's origin, which slowed the tempo of the film. Some editing might have been helpful as there was so much imagery that didn't really push the story of both Batman and Superman being orphans.

This movie really shows how Batman is the captain of the upcoming Justice League movie. He may not be the strongest or the fastest, but he's the smartest and knows the tactics of winning and is able to take on opponents more powerful than he is.

My second favorite part of the whole film was Wonder Woman. [Gal Gadot](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2933757/) did a marvelous job considering that she didn't have many lines or much screen time. The movie highlights how powerful of a warrior she is-- if need be she could fight Superman on even ground because she's just that skilled in combat. It's actually unclear if Superman was needed in the final fight. Would the *magic* of her shield and sword have been able to defeat/behead Doomsday? We've only been given a small taste of what to expect.

I look forward to her [Wonder Woman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0451279/) film in 2017.

I wasn't a fan of [Jesse Eisenberg](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0251986/)'s Lex Luthor, as I saw more quirky Eisenberg than Luthor. Many of his scenes took me out of the movie instead of convincing me that he is a brilliant businessman/politician who knows how to manipulate everyone around him. For instance, the scene where Luthor had to give a speech at his own party in his own house should have been captivating-- instead it was just awkward.

Perhaps this modern take will appeal to today's millennials as we redefine what is a successful business mogul. It's not who is the most rich, but who is most conniving, manipulative, and intelligent that seeks out and obtains power. The WB released a deleted scene, [Communion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-MUzvASr8s), which hints that Luthor knows more about whats to come than anyone. I'm open to where they are going with this new age Lex Luthor. The *real estate businessman* of the past films have been done to death.

### Final Thoughts

Based off his past work, Snyder can put together visually stunning movies, but the script and story-telling is weak. That's basically the problem with BvS. The characters leaping in the air, standing or walking in a field, and jumping into a fight all looks great in his films, but it's being over-used.

The term, *meta-humsns*, is used to describe Wonder Woman, Cyborg, The Flash, and Aquaman in a an Lex Luthor's encrypted files. There's a [DC Unified Origin Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_IlBq7j7oQ),
