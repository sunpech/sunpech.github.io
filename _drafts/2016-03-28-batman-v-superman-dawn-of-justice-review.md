Over the weekend I saw [Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2975590/). In a nutshell, I thought it was okay, but not great-- nor does it match the hype.  **This post does contain SPOILERS, so don't read any further if you haven't seen it yet or don't mind!**

You've been warned....

I [reviewed Man of Steel](/2013/06/man-of-steel-review) several years ago and gave it a generally positive review for *sci-fi Superman* reimagining.

#### Lex Luthor

I wasn't a fan of Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor, as I saw more quirky Eisenberg than Luthor. But at least they didnt make him all about real estate/property like all the previous movie incarnations. Perhaps this modern take appeals to today's millennials and tech business startups.
