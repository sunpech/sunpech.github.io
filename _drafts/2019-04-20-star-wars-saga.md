The latest trailer, Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker, has me asking, what is the story of Star Wars?

How I would describe Star Wars:

* Space Fantasy
* Good Vs Evil (Jedi vs Sith)
* Politics (Rebels vs The Empire)
* Love, Forbidden love


## Prequel Trilogy (Episodes 1-3)
* The Phantom Menace
* Attack of the Clones
* Revenge of the Sith

The prophecy of the one that will balance to the force. Anakin, born from the force. Introduced to Palpatine, the senator, sith lord, and the phantome menace.

## Original Trilogy (Episodes 4-6)
* A New Hope
* Empire Strikes Back
* Return of the Jedi

## Current Trilogy (Episodes 7-9)
* The Force Awakens
* The Last Jedi
* The Rise of Skywalker

## What does the title, The Rise of Skywalker, refer to?

* Kylo Ren redemption Arc?
* Is Rey secretly a Skywalker?
* Star Wars trilogies have not used proper names. Is Skywalker refering to a new type of Jedi? (Except for Solo: A Star Wars Story)

Did any Skywalker fulfill the prophecy of bringing balance to the force? Did Anakin (Darth Vader) do so by turning against Emperor Palpatine? Did Luke/Leia do so by redeeming their father?

Close out the Skywalker saga by bringing balance to the force, fufilling the prophecy, but yet leaving the door open for conflict for future Star Wars movies. The stories of good vs evil will always continue. So what does balance mean?

George Lucas said back in the 1990s that Star Wars was just Episodes 1-6, and it was really about the story of Anakin Skywalker, how he was consumed by the dark side, but was turned back to the light by his children. There was never plans for future trilogies and also that he didn't want to direct any moer if he had to.
