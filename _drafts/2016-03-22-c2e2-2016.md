Over the weekend I went to check out [C2E2](http://www.c2e2.com/). It was the second year that I've attended the show. This year, I went all three days, unlike [last year](/2015/04/c2e2-2015/). The cosplay this year was amazing-- every year cosplayers keep upping their game.

### Friday

The main purpose of Day 1 was to pick up my lanyard, get a lay of the land, walk the exhibit hall, and determine whether I would be permitted to take photos from different positions in the main stage. I went to the [John Cusack](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000131/) Spotlight to test my equipment settings and it was good to hear the advice he had for young actors who are starting out. Overall, a light day compared to the other days.

### Saturday

On Day 2, I went to check out the [Supergirl](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4016454/) Spotlight starring [Melissa Benoist](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2552034/) and [Chyler Leigh](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0500200/). They told the host, [Clare Kramer](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004456/), that it was their first comic convention panel. They did an amazing job telling stories about the show, answering fan questions, and talking about Chyler's obsession with Batgirl.

I also went to check out two of my favorite comic book Youtube stars, [ComicsExplained](https://www.youtube.com/user/fluidicbeats) and [Comicstorian](https://www.youtube.com/user/comicstorian). [DigsBot](https://www.youtube.com/user/DigsBot), Comicstorian's animator, was also on the panel. I met all three of the panelists afterwards and they signed my hand cast. Overall, it was a good day.

### Sunday

On the final day, Day 3, I went to the [J August Richards](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0724124/) Spotlight and the [Chloe Bennet](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4032297/) Spotlight. Both of them are on the show [Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2364582/). I'm amazed at how familiar the fans are with these actors' previous work. I'm also impressed at how J August Richards can cite specific season/episode numbers when discussing the show. Chloe Bennet was hilarious as usual and she is also a native Chicagoan and White Sox fan. C2E2 being in Chicago, fans asked her a lot of local questions and she was able to name places such as [Kuma's](http://www.kumascorner.com/) her favorite burger joint and [Lou Malnati's](http://www.loumalnatis.com/) as her favorite Chicago style pizza (although she said she'd heard that [Pequod's](http://pequodspizza.com/) was good too).
