Over the weekend I went to check out [C2E2](http://www.c2e2.com/). It was the second year that I've attended the show. This year, I went all three days.

### Friday

The highlight of Day 1 was the [John Cusack](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000131/) Spotlight. Overall, a light day compared to the other days.

### Saturday

On Day 2, I went to check out the [Supergirl](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4016454/) Spotlight starring [Melissa Benoist](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2552034/) and [Chyler Leigh](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0500200/). They told the host, [Clare Kramer](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004456/), that it was their first comic convention panel. They did an amazing job telling stories about the show, answering fan questions, and talking about Chyler's obsession with Batgirl.

I also went to check out two of my favorite comic book Youtube stars, [ComicsExplained](https://www.youtube.com/user/fluidicbeats) and [Comicstorian](https://www.youtube.com/user/comicstorian). [DigsBot](https://www.youtube.com/user/DigsBot), Comicstorian's animator, was also on the panel. I met all three of the panelists afterwards and they signed my hand cast. Overall, it was a good day.

### Sunday

On the final day, Day 3, I went to the [J August Richards](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0724124/) Spotlight and the [Chloe Bennet](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4032297/) Spotlight. Both of them are on the show [Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2364582/).
