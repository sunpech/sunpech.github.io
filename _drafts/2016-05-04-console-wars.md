I recently finished reading [Console Wars](http://amzn.to/1RWN3PZ) by [Blake J. Harris](http://www.blakejharris.com/) and I really enjoyed the trip down memory lane. I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s and played on video game systems by [Nintendo](http://www.nintendo.com/), [Sega](http://www.sega.com/), [Sony](http://www.sony.com/), and [Atari](https://www.atari.com/). This review will cover the basics of the book, sprinkled with some of my own memories as a kid during that time.

I first heard of the book through a recommended YouTube channel: [Gaming Historian](https://www.youtube.com/gaminghistorian), a retro-gaming documentary series by [Norman Caruso](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4752197/). Specifically, he reviews the book [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5XAHjBnVTg). He has a ton of great high quality and well researched videos, definitely check out his channel!

Here are a few of my favorites:

* [The Video Game Crash of 1983](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7DJrLAZus)
* [Nintendo vs. Video Game Rentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3xuy5YALl0)
* [The Power Glove](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8JiGjRQNE)
* [The Story of Super Mario Bros. 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EUYSN5aFcE)
* [Tengen: Atari Games vs. Nintendo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLA_d9q6ySs)
* [Nintendo's 3 Biggest Mistakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW_MEKWTguA)
* [Sega Dreamcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xdBVHSrdzg)
* [NES 2 Top Loader (Model NES-101)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSFPdQQez7c)

And there's so much more!

**Console Wars** tells the story of [Tom Kalinske](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kalinske), an American business man behind Sega of America, and how the company challenged not only Nintendo, but the gaming industry as a whole. Most of the book is about Sega and takes place between 1989-1996. The book does cover some of the major players at Nintendo and Sony, but mostly from the point of view of Sega. I'm amazed that the author interviewed over 200 people to put together this book!

### Nintendo

[Nintendo's Entertainment System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System), the NES, was the dominant gaming system during the mid 1980s and early 1990s, until the [Super Nintendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System), the SNES, came out in 1991. Most of the games I own are NES cartridges, followed by SNES cartridges, and then Sony Playstation CDs/DVDs. This wasn't just because I played a lot of games as a kid and less as I grew up, but that time there were local video rental stores such as [Blockbuster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_LLC) that let customers rent video games for a few bucks for a few days to a week. This was significantly cheaper than buying the game outright for $50-75. I remember that cartridges cost more and the royalties by game developers back to Nintendo was a lot, $10 I believe-- so this was always a huge disadvantage to compact discs and what Sony did with their Playstation platform.

![Video Game collection](/public/images/blog/video-game-collection.jpg)

My first experience of the NES was the Famicom console at my cousin's in Thailand during summer vacation in 1986. There were two games my sisters and I played, [Super Mario Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.) and [Ice Climber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Climber). My three sisters and I were all hooked on this system-- instead of going out to explore the local sights and scenery, we wanted to stay in and play video games. It wasn't until I got back to the US that I noticed the NES was available in the [Highland Superstore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_Superstores) here in the midwest where they had [Kung-Fu Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung-Fu_Master) available as a playable demo in store.

The [GameBoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy) was my first big purchase as a kid. I saved up $100 from mowing the lawn and various chores and snuck into [Auchan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auchan) to buy the coveted device. My mom was surprised and definitely not happy that I did that behind her back.

### Sega

The [Sega Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis) was the console that all my friends wanted when we were in sixth grade. The marketing and games available were geared to kids that grew up on the NES, but wanted something more, especially for sports games. [Altered Beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Beast) was a game that looked great and came bundled with the system. I remember playing this game on the demo system at [Kohl's](http://www.kohls.com/) while my mom shopped. The commercials and lines, *Welcome to the Next Level!* or [Sega scream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx-8QBX8qgc) were really well done, as I still remember it today.

I personally never owned a Sega gaming console, but my sisters did with a [Sega Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Saturn) and [Dreamcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast), both failures in terms of market penetration and lack of software/games. The release of both console systems was just poor, as I was more interested in the [Sony Playstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console), based on price alone. The [Game Gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Gear) was sought after device that only a few friends had-- most of us as kids already had GameBoys.

There were really two companies at Sega: Sega of Japan (SoJ) and Sega of America (SoA). The conflicts within the company and poor decisions in how they priced their systems once Sony entered the playing field is the story of the rise and fall that was Sega. Their rise was in how they really were a better company for game developers/companies to work with than the iron clad grip that Nintendo enforced to partner with them and their ecosystem.

### Sony

The [Sony Playstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console) platforms is the console system that I enjoyed for the long term. I have versions 1-3, I skipped out on the [PS4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4) because I just don't game much anymore. But the [PS2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2) is by far the best selling console ever, as for it's time in 2000, it also doubled as a DVD player-- much like the [PS3 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3) also doubled as a Blu-ray player. Overall I just loved Sony's strategy was the one console you could have in your living room for all your entertainment needs.

Nintendo was the cause for Sony to venture out to create a gaming system because they reportedly dropped an *agreed partnership* with them in favor of Phillips. Sega also seemingly showed how a company could compete against the giant that was Nintendo. Sony really benefited from the successes and mistakes made by their predecessors-- they truly were the third console system that had staying power in the 1990s. In case you don't remember, there used to be [3DO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3DO_Interactive_Multiplayer), [Atari Jaguar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Jaguar), and [NEC's Turbo-Grapfx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TurboGrafx-16) to name the more *popular* ones.

### Final Thoughts

I really like this book and recommend to anyone who grew up playing video games in the 80s and 90s. It's really fun to read about what happened behind scenes during this period of my childhood and how things were marketed towards us.

Although the book is titled, *Console Wars: Sega, Nintendo, and the Battle that Defined a Generation*, it really contains material, roughly 90%, about Sega. There's not much content on Nintendo or Sony, which is unfortunate because it would given a more balanced view of the battle.

In some way, this book feels like a volume one of a series of books that could come out. I can see a volume two being about the rise of Sony and how Nintendo made the mistake of sticking with cartridges for the [Nintendo 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64), and of course include material about the [Microsoft Xbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox) for the new generation of gamers. Volume three could be about [Twitch TV](https://www.twitch.tv/) and [YouTube Gamers](https://gaming.youtube.com/) and other streamers. But perhaps this would be 10-15 years in the future as video game streamers and [eSports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESports) is happening right now.

If you crave stories that was left out, check out [Gaming Historian's](https://www.youtube.com/gaminghistorian) YouTube channel where you can learn about the [Game Genie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCvIZ80RIhE), [Nintendo 64DD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VYYsRAAvGU), or [Virtual Boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjz4bls_gPs). Or if you want to watch videos in a set, he's got a [playlist page](https://www.youtube.com/user/mcfrosticles/playlists) too.
