I recently finished reading [Console Wars](http://amzn.to/1RWN3PZ) by [Blake J. Harris](http://www.blakejharris.com/) and I really enjoyed the trip down memory lane. I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s and played on video game systems by [Nintendo](http://www.nintendo.com/), [Sega](http://www.sega.com/), [Sony](http://www.sony.com/), and [Atari](https://www.atari.com/). This is my reflection on this gaming era after reading this book.

I first heard of the book through a recommended YouTube channel: [Gaming Historian](https://www.youtube.com/gaminghistorian), a retro-gaming documentary series by [Norman Caruso](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4752197/). He reviews the book [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5XAHjBnVTg). He has a ton of great high quality and well researched videos, definitely check out his channel if you are into classic gaming.

Here are a few of my favorites:

**Console Wars** tells the story of [Tom Kalinske](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kalinske), an American business man and CEO behind Sega of America during its meteoric rise and fall.  The book takes place between 1989 through 1996, shows how they challenged not only Nintendo but the gaming industry as a whole.

### Nintendo

The [Nintendo Entertainment System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System), or the NES, was the dominant gaming system during the mid 1980s and early 1990s until the [Super Nintendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System), the SNES, came out in 1991. Most of the games I own are NES cartridges, followed by SNES cartridges, and then Sony Playstation CDs/DVDs. This wasn't just because I played a lot of games as a kid and less as I grew up, but that time there were local video rental stores such as [Blockbuster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_LLC) that let customers rent video games for a few bucks for a few days to a week. This was significantly cheaper than buying the game outright for $50-75.

Nintendo exerted a lot of control with companies that wanted to make games for the NES. For one, they were required to buy cartridges at about $10 each and pay 30% of revenue as royalty. This allowed Nintendo to pick and choose who and how many cartridges a company could get. On top of this they had to sign non-compete clauses to give exclusive rights to the game to Nintendo.

The reason behind such control was the [Video Game Crash of 1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_video_game_crash_of_1983)-- year when there was an over saturation of consoles and crappy games in the market. To avoid a repeat, Nintendo had to do quality control over their brand and products. So although it may have sucked to create games for the NES, it was certainly great to be a consumer.

![Video Game collection](/public/images/blog/video-game-collection.jpg)

My first experience of the NES was my cousin's Famicom console in Thailand during summer vacation in 1986. My sisters and I would play two games, [Super Mario Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.) and [Ice Climber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Climber). We were all hooked on this system-- instead of going out to explore the local sights and scenery, we wanted to stay in and play video games. It wasn't until I got back to the US that I noticed the NES was available in the [Highland Superstore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_Superstores), an electronics store chain in the Midwest, which offered [Kung-Fu Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung-Fu_Master) as a playable demo in store.

![Famicon console set](/public/images/blog/famicom-console.jpg)

The [GameBoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy) was my first big purchase as a kid. I saved up $100 from mowing the lawn and various chores and snuck into [Auchan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auchan) to buy the coveted device. My mom was surprised and definitely not happy that I did that behind her back. Looking back now, it was actually a good buy since none of the other mobile consoles did as well on price, marketing, or even hardware in terms of battery life.

### Sega

In the early 90s, the [Sega Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis) was the console that most of my school friends wanted. The marketing and games available were geared to kids who grew up on the NES but wanted something more, especially sports and fighting games. [Altered Beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Beast) was a game that looked great and came bundled with the system. I remember playing this game on the demo system at [Kohl's](http://www.kohls.com/) while my mom shopped.

Kalinske understood that in order for Sega to thrive, they needed to be what Nintendo wasn't. Nintendo's target consumer was kids twelve and under. So Sega created an ad campaign targeting young teens and older. The line, *Welcome to the Next Level!* and the [Sega scream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx-8QBX8qgc) had a kind of rebellious teenage, too grown up for kid stuff feel to it. I was almost a young teen when the Genesis came out and I wanted to be a part of it. However, I personally never owned a Sega gaming console, but my sisters did with a [Sega Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Saturn) and [Dreamcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast) years later.

![Genesis Does Ad](/public/images/blog/genesis-ad.jpg)

Sega released a slew of hardware from the [32x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32X), [Game Gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Gear), to the [Nomad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_Nomad), which were poorly received. I only knew of one person that actually owned a Game Gear while the rest of us had Gameboys, that although had no color, but had more games and a battery life.

During this time, fighting games like [Street Fighter II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_II:_The_World_Warrior) and [Mortal Kombat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat) were all the rage in the arcades. For me it was the 7-11 after school. Not only were these rival games fighting each other, but SNES and Genesis' versions also competed against each other for the fans affection. Nintendo's family friendly policy censored the blood with sweat while Sega's allowed for the fatalities, gore, and blood. My friends and I all would have jumped ship to Sega if we all didn't have Super Nintendos already. I even rented the Genesis console at Blockbuster just to play games like Mortal Kombat, [X-Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(1993_video_game)), and other cool games that *Nintendo-didn't*.

By the mid 90s, Hollywood made [Street Fighter](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111301/) and [Mortal Kombat](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113855/) movies. More importantly, the 16-bit gaming consoles were also at the end of their lifecycle. It was the dawn of the 32-bit era. The next generation of fighting games was going 3D with games such as [Virtua Fighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtua_Fighter) and [Tekken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekken_(video_game)). Another player was going to enter the fight against Nintendo and Sega-- Sony.

### Sony

The [Sony Playstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console) came out in late 1995, after the Sega Saturn which came out earlier that summer. It was the console system my friends and I waited for since it's price tag was $100 cheaper than the Saturn. It was a risk and commitment I took since Sega even price-matched at $299 before Sony's US launch.

I have versions 1-3, I skipped out on the [PS4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4) because I just don't game much anymore. But the [PS2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2) is by far the best selling console ever and also doubled as a DVD player-- much like the [PS3 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3) was also a Blu-ray player. Sony was a name brand and their strategy was that you were never just buying a gaming system, it was also something extra that you were connecting to probably a Sony TV.

![Playstation 1](/public/images/blog/playstation-one.jpg)

At the 1991 Consumer Electronics Show ([CES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Show)), Nintendo originally was going to partner with Sony to create a CD-ROM add-on for the SNES, the [SNES-CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNES-CD), also known as the *Play Station*, but the partnership fell apart with Nintendo choosing Sony's rival, Phillips instead. Just last year, [one of the prototype devices was found](http://www.engadget.com/2015/11/06/nintendo-playstation-is-real-and-it-works/) and actually works!

Over the years Sony gained experience in the industry and decided they could come out with their own console system. Unlike many others, they actually succeeded. In case you don't remember, there used to be [3DO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3DO_Interactive_Multiplayer), [Atari Jaguar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Jaguar), [Philips CD-i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips_CD-i), and [NEC's Turbo-Grapfx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TurboGrafx-16) to name the more *popular* ones.

### Final Thoughts

I really like this book and recommend it to anyone who grew up playing video games in the 80s and 90s. It's really fun to read about what happened behind the scenes during this period of my childhood and how things were marketed towards us.

Although the book is titled, *Console Wars: Sega, Nintendo, and the Battle that Defined a Generation*, most of the book focuses on Sega. There's not much content on Nintendo or Sony, which is unfortunate because it would given a more balanced view of the battle.

In some way, this book feels like the first volume of a series of books that could come out. I can see a volume two being about the rise of Sony and Nintendo's mistake of sticking with cartridges for the [Nintendo 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64), and of course include material about the [Microsoft Xbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox) for the new generation of gamers. Volume three could be about [Twitch TV](https://www.twitch.tv/) and [YouTube Gamers](https://gaming.youtube.com/) and other streamers. But perhaps this would be 10-15 years in the future as video game streamers and [eSports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESports) is happening right now.
