I recently finished reading [Console Wars](http://amzn.to/1RWN3PZ) by [Blake J. Harris](http://www.blakejharris.com/) and I really enjoyed the trip down memory lane. I grew up in the 1980s and 90s and played on video game systems by [Nintendo](http://www.nintendo.com/), [Sega](http://www.sega.com/), [Sony](http://www.sony.com/), and [Atari](https://www.atari.com/). This review will cover the basics of the book, sprinkled with some of my own memories as a kid during that time.

I first heard of the book through a YouTube recommended channel: [Gaming Historian](https://www.youtube.com/gaminghistorian), a retro-gaming documentary series by [Norman Caruso](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4752197/). Specifically, he reviews it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5XAHjBnVTg). He has a ton of great high quality and well researched videos, definitely check out his channel!

**Console Wars** tells the story of [Tom Kalinske](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kalinske), an American business man behind Sega of America, and how the company challenged not only Nintendo, but the gaming industry as a whole. Most of the book is about Sega and takes place between 1989-1996. The book does cover some of the players at Nintendo and Sony, but mostly from the point of view of Sega. I'm amazed that the author interviewed over 200 people to put together this story!

[Nintendo's Entertainment System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System), the NES, was the dominant gaming system during the mid 1980s and early 1990s, until the [Super Nintendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System), the SNES, came out in 1991. Most of the games I own are NES cartridges, followed by SNES cartridges, and then Sony Playstation CDs/DVDs. This wasn't just because I played a lot of games as a kid and less as I grew up, but that time there were local video rental stores such as [Blockbuster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_LLC) that let kids' parents rent video games for a few bucks for a few days to a week, which was significantly cheaper than buying the game outright for $50-75. I remember that cartridges cost more and the royalties by game developers back to Nintendo was a lot, $10 I believe-- so this was always a huge disadvantage than CDs and what Sony did with their Playstation platform.

My first experience of the NES was the Famicom console at my cousin's in [Korat, Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakhon_Ratchasima) during the summer of 1985 (I think). There were two games my sisters and I played, [Super Mario Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.) and [Ice Climber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Climber). My three sisters and I were all hooked on this system-- instead of going out to explore the local sights and scenery, we wanted to stay in and play video games. It wasn't until we got back that I noticed the NES was available in the [Highland Superstore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_Superstores) here in the midwest where they had [Kung-Fu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung-Fu_Master) available as a playable demo in store.
