The last movie from the [MCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) for 2016, [Doctor Strange](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1211837/) came out last week. This is my *spoilery* review which covers some plot points and my thoughts of it's potential impact on the movie universe.

I enjoyed the movie a lot. It formally introduced **magic** and the **multiverse** into Marvel's cinematic universe. This is a big deal. It literally opens the door to infinite possibilities

I like how they elevated [Wong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wong_(comics)) to be more than a butler/sidekick to an actual sorcerer.

When Baron Mordo mentions that his weapon is the staff of the Living Tribunal, I went into shock. [The Living Tribunal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Tribunal) is a cosmic entity that is considered the second most powerful entity in Marvel comics.

Wong confirmed that the [Eye of Agamotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Agamotto) is an Infinity Stone, as many comic fans suspected.
