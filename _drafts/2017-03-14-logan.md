description: My quick spoilery review of Logan. In short, it's a good movie, but very disconnected from current X-Men movie universe.

I liked the movie, but I didn't love [Logan](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3315342/). It was the best Wolverine movie Fox has made, but that bar is rather low to clear. After 17 years of playing the character, it was a good send off for [Hugh Jackman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413168/). He really made the character his own over the years, despite being different from the comics Wolverine.

What I liked about the movie is that it continues to stay true to *Movie Wolverine* character that Jackman has made in his solo movies. His character has always been conflicted about being a team player and helping others unless he really has to. He's lived a long time and has done some terrible things and has lost everyone he's close to. Much like a soldier that's come home from a war with [PTSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder), he can't find peace within.

A movie that is like a one-shot comic that is disconnected from main X-Men franchise.
