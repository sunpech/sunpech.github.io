There are two tech shows that I'm enjoying right now: [Silicon Valley](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/) and [Halt and Catch Fire](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543312/). 

They both deal with the business and culture of technology startups, but yet are pretty different from each other. They both are  on their second season.

Silicon Valley (SV) pokes fun at the today's tech craze in a humorous and ridiculous way. As it should be, technology is hot stuff right now and there's so much money being thrown around as everyone thinks they are going to change the world with their product. I'm not thrilled about the characters, as I find them to be a little over the top and more of the <i>stupid smart</i> kind of way. But I do like how they touch on a lot of relevant issues today.

Halt and Catch Fire (HACF) has a more serious tone as it takes place nearly thirty years ago. The world is so different from today, as there's just not enough venture capital money to fund things. The characters and drama is what drives the show. The first season was just okay, as it was a bit slow, but I see now that it was really a setup for the current season. I didn't think they would have a compelling story to tell after how the first season ended, with this all taking place in the past. But I was wrong. There's still so much drama and stories to tell. I feel so much for each of the main characters with all their dreams and flaws.

Of these two, I'm really enjoying HACF. Even though I was only a child when the events of HACF takes place, I can still relate to the time period. If you weren't even alive during the 1980s, you may have difficulty appreciating the show.

The one thing I have to criticize SV on is that they are becoming a little too much like [Big Bang Theory](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/) (BBT)-- a show that I grew to like, then immediately dislike after a few seasons. The problem is that they're stupid shows about smart people. And that can get old realy quick when characters aren't allowed to change or grow through the seasons. It's unfortunate if a character, especially those in sitcoms, serve only to be a common stereotype show after show.

If you like shows like [Breaking Bad](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/) or [Game of Thrones](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/)
