Destiny has arrived. I watched the [Avengers: Infinity War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/) twice already and I loved it. The first time was the most emotional and suprising, the second time I caught some dialogue I missed and was more relaxed.

It's been over three years since [Kevin Feige announced](https://youtu.be/L2VoJuVfbjI?t=16m32s) the plans for MCU Phase 3, and ten years since the first movie. This is the culmination of everthing that has come before.

*Spoilers below*.

## The Heroes

The heroes that are in the movie are given an appropriate amount of time. It's an all-star cast, and the directors, the [Russo Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo_brothers), did a great job of balancing and giving everyone their moment to shine.

**It's a prequisite to have watched the previous Marvel movies to really enjoy Infinity War.** There were very few slow moments in the movie, as it was just moving from one place to another with tons of action and adventures. No hero origin or backstory is in the movie.


Below are all the MCU movies to date. *Movies in bold are the essential movies to re-watch before Infinity War as they contain information regarding an Infinity Stone or character plot points.*

Phase One:
* Iron Man (2008)
* The Incredible Hulk (2008)
* Iron Man 2 (2010)
* Thor (2011)
* Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)
* **Marvelâ€™s The Avengers (2012)**

Phase Two:
* Iron Man 3 (2013)
* **Thor: The Dark World (2013)**
* Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
* **Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)**
* **Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)**
* Ant-Man (2015)

Phase Three:
* **Captain America: Civil War (2016)**
* **Doctor Strange (2016)**
* **Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)**
* **Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)**
* **Thor: Ragnarok (2017)**
* **Black Panther (2018)**
* Avengers: Infinity War (2018) -- Current

Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America really shined in the movie (ranked in that order mentioned). Thor and Rocket Raccoon had great chemistry with their mission to get Stormbreaker on Nidavellir. Iron Man, Spider Man, and Dr. Strange were fantastic with their mission on planet Titan. Captain America is solid as always with bringing the team on Earth together.

Scarlett Witch and Vision. Tony and Peter. Bucky and Rocket. Starlord and Gamora. Drax and Mantis. It was such a treat to see these heroes interact, crossover, and have their moments.

## The Villains

Thanos is literally the big bad guy in the Marvel Universe.

**He is now the MCU's best villain**, knocking down Erik Killmonger and Loki. The problem with Marvel villains is that they don't get fleshed out as characters. They often show up as "the bad guy" and the audience is supposed to accept that with no story as to what motivates them to do what they do.

Killmonger's father was killed without explanation and he was abandoned to a rough life outside of Wakanda. Loki is the god of mischief-- which if you think about it, makes sense for gods to be mischievous considering they live long lives and I would imagine would get bored of ordinary things.

With Thanos, his backstory is that his homeworld was overpopulated, didn't listen to him, which lead to their demise. Thus his quest to wipe the universe to balance things out.

The Black Order served their purpose. I really liked Ebony Maw, how he was able to go toe-to-toe with Dr. Strange. I think Thanos might have called him E-Maw after he first meets Dr. Strange on Titan? I was a bit disappointed with Proxima Midnight's look and especially how de-powered Corvus Glaive was portrayed in the movie.

## The Ending and Post Credits Scene

Thanos assembles the Infinity Gauntlet and snaps his fingers, wiping out half the population of the universe. Infinity War is like the Empire Strikes Back in the original Star Wars trilogy. The good guys need to know what it's like to lose to come back for a victory in the next movie.

I am uncertain on the status of the Infinity Gauntlet by the end of the movie. It looks burnt and damaged, but it still functioned (snaps fingers and teleported away). Thanos is alone on what looks like a habitable planet/area where he can watch the sunset of a "grateful universe".

As Nick Fury is ashing out of existence, he pages someone. That someone is Captain Marvel. This is a great tease for next year's movie that takes place in the 1990s.

## Avengers 4 Predictions

The title has been held back, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be called **Avengers: Infinity Gauntlet** or **Avengers: Infinity Crusade**.

In this case, the term thrown around by the directors is *sacrifice*. In order to save those that have perished, not everyone is going to make it through the next movie.

Dr. Strange said he peered into the 14,000,650 possible futures where only one had them winning. That one most likely had Tony Stark in it, thus why he was willing to trade the Time stone for Tony's life. Thus Tony will play an important role in the *end game* of the next movie.

Thanos's sacrifice of his favorite daughter, Gamora, was a pivotal moment in the movie. His action gave him the Soul stone. I can see Peter Quill taunting Thanos if he was so powerful, why doesn't he bring Gamora back. In doing so, it would undo the sacrifice and the Soul stone would leave the Infinity Guantlet.

## Final Thoughts

I consider Infinity War to be a huge success for comic book fans and to a degree non-comic-ready-movie-fans, as they finally got a taste of how good the original material in comic books are.

Avengers 3 and 4 was originally announced to be a two part movie. But they changed that since typically movies that are split into two parts aren't well received-- look at Harry Potter and Hunger Games series. It's just better to market them as separate movies that stand on their own rather than incomplete movies without the other.

If you crave more, below are some of the source material the movie pulls from.

### Recommended Reading

For the best overall best read on the Infinity Guantlet stories, I recommend: [Infinity Guantlet Omnibus](https://amzn.to/2r7FNfr). It is the most complete colleciton of stories in one giant book. This is the first place to start reading.

If the omnibus is too much for you, check out [Silver Surfer: Rebirth of Thanos](https://amzn.to/2HzfPIv0), which details Thanos Quest. Follow that up with [Infinity Gauntlet](https://amzn.to/2r6zQzb) and that should be a pretty complete look of where most of the movie drew inspiration from.

For a non-canon story of Thanos, check out: [Marvel Universe: The End](https://amzn.to/2jdfnFe).

To read more on the Black Order, check out: [Infinity](https://amzn.to/2r6pgby). You'll see how badass Ebony Maw and Corvus Glaive really are.

Even more: [Thanos Rising](https://amzn.to/2HBjU38) and [The Thanos Imperative](https://amzn.to/2jgSAIW).
