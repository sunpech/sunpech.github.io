Destiny has arrived. I watched the movie twice already and I loved it.

## Marvel Villains

Thanos is literally the big bad guy in the Marvel Universe.

He is now the MCU's best villain.

### Further Reading

For the best overall best read on the Infinity Guantlet stories, I recommend: [Infinity Guantlet Omnibus](https://amzn.to/2r7FNfr). It is the most complete colleciton of stories in one giant book. This is the first place to start reading.

If the omnibus is too much for you, check out [Silver Surfer: Rebirth of Thanos](https://amzn.to/2HzfPIv0), which details Thanos Quest. Follow that up with [Infinity Gauntlet](https://amzn.to/2r6zQzb) and that should be a pretty complete look of where most of the movie drew inspiration from.

For a non-canon story of Thanos, check out: [Marvel Universe: The End](https://amzn.to/2jdfnFe).

To read more on the Black Order, check out: [Infinity](https://amzn.to/2r6pgby).
