description: My thoughts on the OnePlus, a year later.
---

I consider the OnePlus One I bought [over a year ago](/2014/08/oneplus-one-vs-nexus-5/) a value phone. For it's time, it was a big phone, with great specs, for a low price. Even now, it's still a good phone and is my main mobile device. The battery is good and CM12S operating system is also decent.

When I initially had CM11S running on my phone, the battery life was 2 days of regular usage. When I put Lollipop on it, it dropped to about 1.5 days. Still not bad. Even today, I can get through 1-1.5 days of regular usage before I need to recharge. For me, as a non power-user, it's great.

I certainly value my OPO over my 2013 Nexus 7s-- which I have two broken tablets sitting in a drawer. The Asus tablets are really poorly made.

But it's not all sunshine and rainbows with my OnePlus One (OPO). Outside the actual device hardware, there are things I dislike about the companies and software behind it.

### OnePlus and Cyanogen Problems

The [breakup](http://www.androidauthority.com/cyanogen-ends-partnership-with-oneplus-604572/) between [OnePlus](https://oneplus.net/) and [Cyanogen](https://cyngn.com/) over exclusivity in India is a huge letdown. It seems to indicate that Cyanogen is interested in making money over building a good relationship. They like [talking big](http://www.androidauthority.com/first-cyanogen-phone-without-google-blu-596283/) about taking over the mobile industry, yet burn the bridges they cross. This is unprofessional and immature.

Cyanogen can't keep their word about having an Android port within 90 days (3 months) of a major Android release. When company makes a promise to their fans, they put their name brand on the line. It's better not to give an ETA than to set up paying customers for disappointment.

OnePlus's invite and marketing buzz is rather atrocious. **Their marketing is backwards. You need to deliver a product and make customers happy to get brand loyalty, not ask for it first and then sell customers a product.** The invite system was cute last year, but they're doing it again this year for the [OnePlus Two](https://oneplus.net/invites?kolid=NN0HB5). On top of that, a student developer [hacked their invite system](https://medium.com/@JakeCooper/so-nice-i-did-it-twice-hacking-the-oneplus-reservation-system-again-2e8226c45f9a), twice just to jump the queue. The count of actual individuals interested in their is no where near what is stated.

It's almost as if OnePlus took their marketing plan from [South Park's Cartmanland](https://youtu.be/crosjxD4XaI). Trying to create buzz by showing something interesting, but that most people can't have. Lame.

### Final Thoughts

**There's room to disrupt the mobile industry with an inexpensive device that runs custom lightweight Android that is also well supported.** *That's what I was hoping both OnePlus and Cyanogen could do together.* So far I've been disappointed with both. One can't figure out how to sell the hardware and is now also jumping into making the software too. The other talks big and can't deliver the software.

I still enjoy my OnePlus One phone and I have no plans to upgrade to a OnePlus Two. Even if something were to happen to my phone, say I break it, then I would consider the OnePlus Two-- but only if I could get it when I needed it. The level of uncertainty to actually getting the device is ridiculous. I am the master of what I own and buy, not the other way around.

I actually find the [Moto G](https://www.motorola.com/us/motomaker?pid=FLEXR4&action=designNew#memory) to be interesting at $220. See: [MKBHD's Moto G 2015 Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HDKRP4nzc0).

Maybe I'm an old fashioned geek here, but I refuse to spend $500+ for a smartphone. For my needs, I'd rather get a decked out main laptop (Macbook Pro) where I can do all my computing needs. The smartphone/device is just a consumption device. Yeah sure we have GPS, voice search, and other goodies that's part of the "mobile" experience, but **my vision of the world is that everything around us will be a mobile device that talks with everything else**-- that compliments what we do on our phone currently. Our cars should all have a GPS and app that detects traffic. Our refrigerator should know when we need to stock up on food/drinks. Our homes should know when open the doors, secure the house, turn on/off the lights, etc.

I've seen people walk around with severely cracked iPhones, and use them to take photos and put up against their face to talk. My guess is that their contract isn't up or they can't simply replace or upgrade their device. I just think that it's wrong for such a commodity to have such control over us.
