I donate my computer's idle time to help solve complex problems through <a href="http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/">World Community Grid</a>.

There are many projects that you can be a part of to help make the world a better place.  You could be a part of the research to help find the cure for AIDs or Cancer!  By simply installing the program and running it on your computer as a screensaver when you aren't using it, you would be a part of a huge network of individuals all over the world on this initiative to help accelerate research in humanitarian causes, scientific development, and technological breakthroughs.
