I donate my computer's idle time to help solve complex problems through <a href="http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/">World Community Grid</a>.

There are many projects that you can be a part of to help make the world a better place.  You could be a part of the research to help find the cure for AIDs or Cancer!  By simply installing the program and running it on your computer as a screensaver when you aren't using it, you would be a part of a huge network of individuals all over the world on this initiative to help accelerate research in humanitarian causes, scientific development, and technological breakthroughs.

I'm looking for individuals to join my team and be a part of this.
